              "' Albedo  Albedo () (, meaning \\'whiteness\\') is the measure of the diffuse reflection of solar radiation out of the total solar radiation received by an astronomical body (e.g. a planet like Earth).  It is dimensionless and measured on a scale from 0 (corresponding to a black body that absorbs all incident radiation) to 1 (corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation).   Surface albedo is defined as the ratio of radiosity to the irradiance (flux per unit area) received by a surface.  The proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself, but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earth\\'s surface.  These factors vary with atmospheric composition, geographic location and time (see position of the Sun).  While bi-hemispherical reflectance is calculated for a single angle of incidence (i.e., for a given position of the Sun), albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period.  The temporal resolution may range from seconds (as obtained from flux measurements) to daily, monthly, or annual averages.   Unless given for a specific wavelength (spectral albedo), albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation.  Due to measurement constraints, it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface (between 0.3 and 3 μm). This spectrum includes visible light (0.39–0.7 μm), which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark (e.g., trees absorb most radiation), whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright (e.g., snow reflects most radiation).   Albedo is an important concept in climatology, astronomy, and environmental management (e.g., as part of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program for sustainable rating of buildings).  The average albedo of the Earth from the upper atmosphere, its \"planetary albedo\", is 30–35% because of cloud cover, but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features.   The term albedo was introduced into optics by Johann Heinrich Lambert in his 1760 work \"Photometria\".   Section::::Terrestrial albedo.   Any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about 0.9 for fresh snow to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances.  Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body.  When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4.  The average albedo of Earth is about 0.3.  This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.   Earth\\'s surface albedo is regularly estimated via Earth observation satellite sensors such as NASA\\'s MODIS instruments on board the Terra and Aqua satellites, and the CERES instrument on the Suomi NPP and JPSS.  As the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite, not all directions, a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional-hemispherical reflectance and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g.,).  These calculations are based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle.  BDRF can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo.   Earth\\'s average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about 15\\xa0°C.  If Earth were frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective), the average temperature of the planet would drop below −40\\xa0°C. If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0\\xa0°C.  In contrast, if the entire Earth was covered by water — a so-called ocean planet — the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost 27\\xa0°C.   Section::::Terrestrial albedo.:White-sky, black-sky, and blue-sky albedo.   For land surfaces, it has been shown that the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle \"θ\" can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms:   BULLET::::- the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle, formula_1, sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo, and  BULLET::::- the bi-hemispherical reflectance, formula_2, sometimes referred to as white-sky albedo.   with formula_3 being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle, and formula_4 being the proportion of diffuse illumination, the actual albedo formula_5 (also called blue-sky albedo) can then be given as:  This formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.   Section::::Astronomical albedo.  The albedos of planets, satellites and minor planets such as asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties.  The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle (\"phase angle\"), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of photometry.  For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos.  For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer Solar System objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids.   Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar System, with 99% of EM radiation reflected.  Another notable high-albedo body is Eris, with an albedo of 0.96.  Many small objects in the outer Solar System and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about 0.05.  A typical comet nucleus has an albedo of 0.04.  Such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compounds.   The overall albedo of the Moon is measured to be around 0.136, but it is strongly directional and non-Lambertian, displaying also a strong opposition effect. Although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains, they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless Solar System bodies.   Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band) geometric albedo (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the Bond albedo (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected).  Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.   In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five Hapke parameters which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle, including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces.   The correlation between astronomical (geometric) albedo, absolute magnitude and diameter is:  formula_7,  where formula_8 is the astronomical albedo, formula_9 is the diameter in kilometers, and formula_10 is the absolute magnitude.   Section::::Examples of terrestrial albedo effects.   Section::::Examples of terrestrial albedo effects.:Illumination.   Albedo is not directly dependent on illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light, except in circumstances where a change in illumination induces a change in the Earth\\'s surface at that location (e.g. through albedo-temperature feedback). That said, albedo and illumination both vary by latitude.  Albedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the subtropics, with a local maximum in the tropics.   Section::::Examples of terrestrial albedo effects.:Insolation effects.   The intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation (solar irradiance); high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation, where areas such as the Sahara Desert, which also have a relatively high albedo, will be hotter due to high insolation.  Tropical and sub-tropical rainforest areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts, which have lower insolation.  Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes.   Arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb, effectively cooling the Earth.  This has been a concern since arctic ice and snow has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures, creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker (being water or ground which is darker color) and reflects less heat back into space. This feedback loop results in a reduced albedo effect.   Section::::Examples of terrestrial albedo effects.:Climate and weather.   Albedo affects climate by determining how much radiation a planet absorbs.  The uneven heating of Earth from albedo variations between land, ice, or ocean surfaces can drive weather.   Section::::Examples of terrestrial albedo effects.:Albedo–temperature feedback.   When an area\\'s albedo changes due to snowfall, a snow–temperature feedback results.  A layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling.  In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g., a warm air mass), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow–temperature feedback.  However, because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher insolation) cause melting.  When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass or soil, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating.  Section::::Examples of terrestrial albedo effects.:Snow.   Snow albedo is highly variable, ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow, to about 0.4 for melting snow, and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow.  Over Antarctica snow albedo averages a little more than 0.8.  If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack (the ice–albedo positive feedback).   Just as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow, the albedo of snow-covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water.  Sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow.  When sea ice melts, either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above, the snow-covered surface is reduced, and more surface of sea water is exposed, so the rate of energy absorption increases.  The extra absorbed energy heats the sea water, which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts. As with the preceding example of snowmelt, the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback.  Both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important to the modern theory of Global warming.   Cryoconite, powdery windblown dust containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.   The dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback, together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo, can lead to large errors in energy estimates.  Because of this, in order to reduce the error of energy estimates, it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regions.   Section::::Examples of terrestrial albedo effects.:Small-scale effects.   Albedo works on a smaller scale, too.  In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.   Section::::Examples of terrestrial albedo effects.:Solar photovoltaic effects.   Albedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic devices.  For example, the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions. Research showed impacts of over 10%.  More recently, the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both human-made and natural) and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies: industrial (solar farms), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications.   Section::::Examples of terrestrial albedo effects.:Trees.   Because forests generally have a low albedo, (the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis), some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation (or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation).  In the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect.  Trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through evapotranspiration.  The water vapor causes cooling on the land surface, causes heating where it condenses, acts a strong greenhouse gas, and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds. Scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact, and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate.   In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily.  Deciduous trees have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas coniferous trees have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.  Variation in summer albedo across both forest types is correlated with maximum rates of photosynthesis because plants with high growth capacity display a greater fraction of their foliage for direct interception of incoming radiation in the upper canopy.  The result is that wavelengths of light not used in photosynthesis are more likely to be reflected back to space rather than being absorbed by other surfaces lower in the canopy.   Studies by the Hadley Centre have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests.  They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g., Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.   Section::::Examples of terrestrial albedo effects.:Water.  Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials.  The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the Fresnel equations (see graph).   At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner (not diffusely).  The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this.  At small angles of incident light, waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.   Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the terminator (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles).  However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction.  Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.   Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities.  Fresh \\'black\\' ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.  Snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to 0.9.   Section::::Examples of terrestrial albedo effects.:Clouds.   Cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures.  Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8.  \"On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water.  Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth.\"   Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic.  A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10\\xa0°C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.   Section::::Examples of terrestrial albedo effects.:Aerosol effects.   Aerosols (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on Earth\\'s radiative balance.  The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties) is less certain.  As per Spracklen et al.  the effects are:  BULLET::::- \"Aerosol direct effect.\" Aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation.  The scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling, whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming.   BULLET::::- \"Aerosol indirect effect.\"  Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called cloud condensation nuclei.  Increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations, which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo, increased light scattering and radiative cooling (\"first indirect effect\"), but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud (\"second indirect effect\").   Section::::Examples of terrestrial albedo effects.:Black carbon.   Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles.  The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m. Black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo.   Section::::Examples of terrestrial albedo effects.:Human activities.   Human activities (e.g., deforestation, farming, and urbanization) change the albedo of various areas around the globe.  However, quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult.  Section::::Other types of albedo.   Single-scattering albedo is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles.  It depends on properties of the material (refractive index); the size of the particle or particles; and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.   Section::::Acquisition.

Section::::Examples of terrestrial albedo effects.:Insolation effects.   The intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation (solar irradiance); high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation, where areas such as the Sahara Desert, which also have a relatively high albedo, will be hotter due to high insolation.  Tropical and sub-tropical rainforest areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts, which have lower insolation.  Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes.   Arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb, effectively cooling the Earth. \",\n",

              " {'body': \"This has been a concern since arctic ice and snow has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures, creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker (being water or ground which is darker color) and reflects less heat back into space. This feedback loop results in a reduced albedo effect.   Section::::Examples of terrestrial albedo effects.:Climate and weather.   Albedo affects climate by determining how much radiation a planet absorbs.  The uneven heating of Earth from albedo variations between land, ice, or ocean surfaces can drive weather.   Section::::Examples of terrestrial albedo effects.:Albedo–temperature feedback.   When an area's albedo changes due to snowfall, a snow–temperature feedback results.  A layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling.  In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g., a warm air mass), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow–temperature feedback.  However, because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher insolation) cause melting. \",\n",

              " {'body': 'When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass or soil, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating.  Section::::Examples of terrestrial albedo effects.:Snow.   Snow albedo is highly variable, ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow, to about 0.4 for melting snow, and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow.  Over Antarctica snow albedo averages a little more than 0.8.  If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack (the ice–albedo positive feedback).   Just as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow, the albedo of snow-covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water.  Sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow.  When sea ice melts, either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above, the snow-covered surface is reduced, and more surface of sea water is exposed, so the rate of energy absorption increases.

              " {'body': 'The extra absorbed energy heats the sea water, which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts. As with the preceding example of snowmelt, the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback.  Both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important to the modern theory of Global warming.   Cryoconite, powdery windblown dust containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.   The dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback, together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo, can lead to large errors in energy estimates.  Because of this, in order to reduce the error of energy estimates, it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regions.   Section::::Examples of terrestrial albedo effects.:Small-scale effects.   Albedo works on a smaller scale, too.  In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.

Research showed impacts of over 10%.  More recently, the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both human-made and natural) and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies: industrial (solar farms), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications.   Section::::Examples of terrestrial albedo effects.:Trees.   Because forests generally have a low albedo, (the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis), some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation (or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation).  In the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect.  Trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through evapotranspiration. ',\n",

              " {'body': 'The water vapor causes cooling on the land surface, causes heating where it condenses, acts a strong greenhouse gas, and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds. Scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact, and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate.   In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily.  Deciduous trees have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas coniferous trees have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.  Variation in summer albedo across both forest types is correlated with maximum rates of photosynthesis because plants with high growth capacity display a greater fraction of their foliage for direct interception of incoming radiation in the upper canopy.  The result is that wavelengths of light not used in photosynthesis are more likely to be reflected back to space rather than being absorbed by other surfaces lower in the canopy.   Studies by the Hadley Centre have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests.  They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g., Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming. ',\n",

              " {'body': ' Section::::Examples of terrestrial albedo effects.:Water.  Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials.  The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the Fresnel equations (see graph).   At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner (not diffusely).  The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this.  At small angles of incident light, waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.   Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the terminator (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles).  However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction.  Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.   Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. ',\n",

Cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures.  Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8.  \"On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water.  Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth.\"   Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic.

But Wilson had second thoughts. “A friend who had had breast cancer suggested I get a second opinion on my pathology and my gut told me that was the thing to do,” she wrote. When she went to two other pathologists, both confirmed a cancer diagnosis. “I share this to educate others that a second opinion is critical to your health,” she said. “You have nothing to lose if both opinions match up for the good, and everything to gain if something that was missed is found, which does happen. Early diagnosis is key.” Wilson is the second celebrity in a week to do a public service announcement for early cancer detection.

Prognosis for infiltrating and invasive lobular breast carcinomas will naturally be influenced by tumor size, grade, stage and hormone receptor status.. However, lobular breast cancers, when positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors, tend to respond very well to hormone therapy. The overall breast cancer survival rates for infiltrating lobular carcinoma, when matched by stage, are a little higher than for ductal carcinoma for the first 5 years. Survival rates range from about 77% to 93%, but on average the 5 year survival rate was estimated at about 90%. How old are these figures, Doc? The general range of survival 77% to 93% is over 10 years old so expect higher now. The average survival rate of 90% was as of 2010, so still quite old. Infiltrating/Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)Infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the generic type (NOS) is by far the most common breast cancer type, and represents about 78% of all cases.\n",

These parameters can be entered into models that provide a statistical probability of systemic spread. The probability of systemic spread is a key factor in determining whether radiation and chemotherapy are worthwhile. The individual parameters are important also because they can predict how well a cancer will respond to specific chemotherapy agents.

The difference is determined by the size of the tumor and the lymph nodes with evidence of cancer. Stage 1A breast cancer means the following description applies: The tumor is smaller than the approximate size of a peanut (2 centimeters or smaller) AND has not spread to the lymph nodes. Stage 1B breast cancer means one of the following descriptions applies: Lymph nodes have cancer evidence with small clusters of cells between the approximate size of a pinprick to the approximate width of a grain of rice (.2mm to 2.0 mm). AND EITHER No actual tumor is found in the breast. OR The tumor is smaller than the approximate size of a peanut (2 centimeters or smaller).

Guided by imaging (ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI), cryoablation inserts a special freezing probe (a type of catheter) through the skin and to the tumor to be treated. Once the tip of the probe is in the right spot inside the tumor core, pressurized argon gas is injected through the probe into the tumor, freezing and destroying the cancerous tissue. Cryoablation techniques may vary from one cancer treatment facility to another. Cryoablation is more common in cases where the breast cancer is being well controlled by systemic treatments.\n",

There are about 20,000 genes in each cell of the human body. Together, they make up the blueprint for the human body and how it works. A person's genetic makeup is called a genotype. Information Genes are made of DNA. Strands of DNA make up part of your chromosomes. Chromosomes have matching pairs of 1 copy of a specific gene. The gene occurs in the same position on each chromosome. Genetic traits, such as eye color, are dominant or recessive: Dominant traits are controlled by 1 gene in the pair of chromosomes. Recessive traits need both genes in the gene pair to work together. Many personal characteristics, such as height, are determined by more than 1 gene. However, some diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, can be caused by a change in a single gene. ||| What other diseases are caused by a single change? ||| The four types of (human) Genetic diseases are:1) Single-gene/monogenic Genetic Diseases: In this category the starting point is a mutation/change in one gene. The next question is how a change in the sequence of a single gene can cause severe disorders. Genes code for proteins which are some of the most important tools for the living beings, and also take place in the structures of the cells. The results of a mutation that happens in a part of gene that codes for a functional part of a protein are unwelcome. The protein is no more functional and as a result, many severe consequences take place. Almost 6000 single gene disorders are known and it is estimated that 1 of 200 newborns face a single gene genetic disorder. Some of these are sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, Aicardi Syndrome, Huntington’s disease. ||| What are the other types of diseases?\n"

Macro-parasites are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms that are large enough to be seen with the naked eye.  Macro-parasites, like other parasites are metabolically dependent on other living organisms, referred to as the host organism.  Most parasites grow inside the host but generally reproduce by infective stages outside of the host.  Type of macro-parasites.  There are many species of macro-parasites.  The most common of these include nematodes, ticks, mites and flatworms.  Macro-parasites can be either classed as endoparasites; parasites that live inside the host, or ectoparasites; parasites that live on the host.  Examples of endoparasites include flukes and tapeworms, while examples of ectoparasites include mosquitoes, fleas, ticks, leeches and lice.  Examples of diseases caused by macro-parasites.  There are many diseases and ailments caused by macro-parasites as well as micro-parasites that affect plants, animals and humans.

Most of blue Fugates never suffered any health effects and lived into their 80s and 90s.  \"If you are between 1 percent and 10 percent, no one knows you have an abnormal level and this might be the case in a lot of unsuspecting patients,\" he said.  Many other recessive gene diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, Tay Sachs and cystic fibrosis can be lethal, he said.  \"If I carry a bad recessive gene with a rare abnormality and married, the child probably wouldn\\'t be sick, because it\\'s very rare to meet another person with the [  same] bad gene and the most frequent cause therefore is in-breeding,\" Tefferi said.  Such was the case with the Fugates.  Martin Fugate came to Troublesome Creek from France in 1820 and family folklore says he was blue.  He married Elizabeth Smith, who also carried the recessive gene.  Of their seven children, four were reported to be blue.  There were no railroads and few roads outside the region, so the community remained small and isolated.  The Fugates married other Fugate cousins and families who lived nearby, with names like Combs, Smith, Ritchie and Stacy. ', 'id': 'MARCO_00_51798579-4', 'score': -2.9216485}\n",

Cord blood can be banked two ways – in public banks for use by anyone in need whose cell type is a match, and in private banks where it is only available to the family of the child who donated.  There is little doubt that scientists believe umbilical cord blood stem cells hold promise for the future.  Cord blood stem cells are already used to treat blood disorders such as aplastic anemia, and research is underway to determine if they can treat other more common conditions like type 1 diabetes.  But many experts question whether many companies\\'s marketing materials confuse or even mislead parents about the usefulness of private banking.  Private cord blood banking costs $2,000 to $3,000 for the initial fee, and around another $100 per year for storage.

It can also be caused by syphilis and certain fungi.   A similar appearance can be associated with histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and coccidioidomycosis.   Section::::Appearance.   In caseous necrosis no histological architecture is preserved.  On microscopic examination with H&E staining, it is characterized by acellular pink areas of necrosis surrounded by a granulomatous inflammatory process.   When the hilar lymph node for instance is infected with tuberculosis and leads to caseous necrosis, its gross appearance can be a cheesy tan to white, which is why this type of necrosis is often depicted as a combination of both coagulative and liquefactive necrosis.   However, in the lung, extensive caseous necrosis with confluent cheesy tan granulomas is typical.

Pregnancy has a positive effect on the prognosis of breast cancer according to several studies also it apparently increases the chance of survival after diagnosis of this tumor disease.  Possible positive effects of pregnancy could be explained by the persistence of fetal cells in the blood and maternal tissues.   Fetal cells are probably actively migrating from peripheral blood into the tumor tissue where they are preferentially settled in the tumor stroma and their concentration decreases as they get closer to the healthy breast tissue.  There are two suggested mechanisms by which the fetal cells could have the positive effect on the breast cancer prognosis.  First mechanism suggests that fetal cells only oversee cancer cells and they attract components of the immune system if needed. ', 'id': 'KILT_2507552-6', 'score': -8.498347}\n",

The carcinogen benzene and nitrites used as meat additives can also be culprits, as well as certain antibiotics, including dapsone and chloroquine.  The genetic form of methemoglobinemia is caused by one of several genetic defects, according to Tefferi.  The Fugates probably had a deficiency in the enzyme called cytochrome-b5 methemoglobin reductase, which is responsible for recessive congenital methemoglobinemia.  Normally, people have less than about 1 percent of methemoglobin, a type of hemoglobin that is altered by being oxidized so is useless in carrying oxygen in the blood.

In contrast, women without male fetal cells who had lupus nephritis showed a more serious form of glomerulonephritis and higher levels of serum creatinine.   The specific role that fetal cells play in microchimerism related to certain autoimmune diseases is not fully understood.  However, one hypothesis states that these cells supply antigens, causing inflammation and triggering the release of different foreign antigens.  This would trigger autoimmune disease instead of serving as a therapeutic.  A different hypothesis states that fetal microchimeric cells are involved in repairing tissues.  When tissues get inflamed, fetal microchimeric cells go to the damaged site and aid in repair and regeneration of the tissue.

There have been reports of fetal cells in the lining of the blood and thyroid glands of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease.

In an analysis of more than 14,000 patients with stage 2 and 3 colorectal cancer who had surgery to remove tumors, followed by treatment to prevent recurrence, the 1,218 African-American patients had a lower five-year survival rate than their white counterparts, according to researchers, led by Greg Yothers of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project Biostatistical Center in Pittsburgh.  Five years after diagnosis, 72.8 percent of white patients survived cancer, but only 68.2 percent of blacks survived.  Colorectal cancer isn't the only medical condition that disproportionately affects certain races.

Primary brain tumors are named according to the type of cells or the part of the brain in which they begin.  For example, most primary brain tumors begin in glial cells.  This type of tumor is called a glioma.  Glioma: Gliomas begin from glial cells found in the supportive tissue of the brain.  There are several types of gliomas, categorized by where they are found, and where the tumor begins.  The following are gliomas: Astrocytoma: The tumor arises from star-shaped glial cells called astrocytes.  It can be any grade.  In adults, an astrocytoma most often arises in the cerebrum.  Grade I or II astrocytoma: It may be called a low-grade glioma.  Grade III astrocytoma: It's sometimes called a high-grade or an anaplastic astrocytoma.  Grade IV astrocytoma: It may be called a glioblastoma (GBM) or malignant astrocytic glioma.  Oligodendroglioma: The tumor arises from cells that make the fatty substance that covers and protects nerves.  It usually occurs in the cerebrum.  It's most common in middle-aged adults.  It can be grade II or III. \n",

This type of tumor accounts for about one third of brain tumors in adults.  The tumor arises in the meninges.  It can be grade I, II, or III.  It's usually benign (grade I) and grows slowly.  Among children, the most common tumor types are: Medulloblastoma: The tumor usually arises in the cerebellum.  It's sometimes called a primitive neuroectodermal tumor.  It is grade IV.  Grade I or II astrocytoma: In children, this low-grade tumor occurs anywhere in the brain.  The most common astrocytoma among children is juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma.  It's grade I. Ependymoma: The tumor arises from cells that line the ventricles or the central canal of the spinal cord.  It's most commonly found in children and young adults.  It can be grade I, II, or III.

This local extension is the most common way bladder cancer spreads.  By accessing the lymphatic system, cancer can also spread.  The lymphatic circulation is a whole circulation system in the body (somewhat like the blood circulatory system) that drains into various lymph nodes.  That is called lymphatic spread.  Bladder cancer can propagate in this manner.  If it does, it usually first spreads to the lymph nodes in the pelvis, surrounding the bladder (perivesicular lymph nodes).  From there, it could spread to lymph nodes which are in close proximity to the external iliac and internal iliac arteries and veins, which are the very large blood vessels that run into the leg and into the pelvis, respectively.  The presence of lymph node spread is best evaluated by CT scan or at surgical exploration.  Bladder cancer can also spread through the bloodstream.  Cancer cells gain entry to distant organs through the bloodstream and also the tumors that originate from cells’ travel to other organs are called metastases. \n",

June 9, 2011— -- The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety says that SUVs are now statistically safer than they were in the past and released their list of the safest – and most dangerous – SUVs on the market today.  The Institute's research demonstrates that driver death rates have dropped due largely to the widespread availability of electronic stability control systems (ESC), which reduce vehicle rollover rates.  \"The rollover risk in SUVs used to outweigh their size/weight advantage, but that's no longer the case, thanks to ESC,\" Anne McCartt, the Institute's senior vice president for research, said in a statement released today.  The overall driver death rate for 2005-08 models during 2006-09 was 48 per million registered vehicle years.

Such regions include Africa, the Middle East, and Australia.  Desert agriculture is the farming of crops well-suited for arid conditions, such as sorghum.  Desert agroforestry is the growing of crops with the environmental support of trees in desert or arid areas.  By incorporating these two agricultural techniques,countries should expect two results.  One is the increase in food in desert regions due to the successful growth of specific crops that are well-suited to the dry and hot environment.  Other crops would require many more resources and much more maintenance in order to just survive in such a climate.  The other is the prevention of desertification, which is defined by “Desertification” (2006) as the destruction of animal and plant life in arid areas due to human actions, by the active revegetation of arid lands.  Region-specific Agriculture According to Markwei, Ndlovu, Robinson, and Shah (2010), “A broader perspective [  to reducing hunger in Africa] encompasses an integrated agricultural commodity value chain from production through to processing and marketing with a local and regional perspective. \n",

            "Text: The term \"organic\" agriculture refers to a species cultivated devoid of any synthetic aid, whether that be in the form of genetic modification or applied synthetic fertilizers and pesticides.It is defined that organic is the use of \"farming practices that may be agroecological, sustainable, or ecological; utilizing natural (non-synthetic) nutrient-cycling processes; exclude or rarely use synthetic pesticides; and sustain or regenerate soil quality\" (Badgley, 2006). Organic agriculture has been around for centuries through small farmers who farmed organically to support their families and their local communities.  It was traditionally an interdependent cycle between livestock, animal farming, and crop farming.  This process works cyclically; livestock provide food for the family as well as manure, waste products that can fertilize crops that in turn feed the family and the livestock.  This essentially makes the process free of any artificial materials and is self-sustainable.  Though organic has been known to include not just the farming process, but also packaging, shipping and consumer processes, for the sake of this site, only the farming process will be under consideration with the use of the term \"organic\".  And therefore it’s clear that there is a well-established dichotomy that exists between \"industrial\" and \"organic\" agricultural methods in society. \n",

We can then combine the two plans into our solution: organic industrial agriculture.  Organic industrial agriculture aims to combine the production ability of large industrial farms with the sustainability of organic farms.  Farmers would still rely on mechanized processes but would also use natural fertilizers and herbicides.  The mechanized processes would still allow for mass production while the new fertilizers would be safer on the soil and the plants The reason a hybridization is being proposed is because it is virtually impossible at this time, to completely convert all industrial practices into organic ones.  The industrialized portion of modern agriculture has led to it's speed in producing large quantities of food.

Unfortunately, unlike lentigo, black spots on the gums that signify periodontal disease are a serious sign that your cat's health is at risk.  Black spots on the gums in association with periodontal disease generally indicate that the teeth, roots of the teeth, or even the gumsthemselves are decaying.  Once a cat has developed periodontitis, it cannot be reversed through tooth brushing at home.  Determining Cause There are a few easy ways to tell the difference between periodontitisand lentigo.  Lentigohas no additional symptoms, since it's just a build-up of melanin.  However, periodontitismay have many other symptoms, including: Sensitivity - Cats with poor oral health may avoid being petted on the face, or lash out if you touch them near their mouth.  Smell - Oral disease is often accompanied by a very bad smell.  If your cat's breath smells particularly bad, they may have periodontitis.  Bleeding - If the gums are sick enough to be changing colors, chances are your cat's mouth is bleeding.  If you don't see blood in their water after they drink, try gently poking their gumlineand see if it bleeds. \n",

That said, it is highly recommended you have one before removing your cat’s cone.  The last thing you want is to remove your cat’s cone only to find out it bites its stitches and gets an infection.  How To Keep Cat From Chewing Stitches Without A Cone If you don’t want to use a cone there are some cat cone alternatives to stop your cat from biting.  Most of them are a total waste of time in all honesty.  There are only two that may work.  The first option is a high-quality pet based surgical tape.  They are soft, lightweight and porous while providing protection for your cat’s stitches.  It is self-adhering so you just roll it around your cats wound and it sticks to itself.  Some cats are able to remove the surgical tape via biting and scratching though.  This is the main reason most veterinarians will always recommend a cat cone as it stops biting.  The second option is a cat shirt.  Although not their primary purpose, they do have the ability to stop your cat from chewing its stitches. \n",

Sometimes you can get your cat used to its cone by putting it on for an hour and leaving it off for an hour.  This does depend on the type of surgery your cat has had and will require constant supervision.  If your cat begins to focus on the stitches when the cone is removed, put the cone back on.  Not only will this stop your cat biting its stitches but it will also help with negative reinforcement.  Your cat will quickly associate biting its stitches with having the cone put on.

If this is the reason that your cat has stopped scratching then these tips are unlikely to help.

The catnip attracts your cat to the pad and gets it curious and encourages it to play.  The smell of the catnip increase your cat’s energy levels and increases the chance your cat will actually start scratching the pad.  Provided you use a good scratch pad with catnip in it there is a good chance your cat will enjoy it.  There are two main reasons your cat will scratch.  The first is to mark its territory.  If you only have one or two cats in your home then this instinct will likely be suppressed.  The second is to shed their claws.  If you get a cheap scratch pad then it may not provide the required friction for this meaning your cat won’t use it.  If you have already bought a fancy scratch pad that does not contain any catnip.

Within a short period of time after consuming milk or a milk protein, you may experience the following symptoms: Hives Stomach upset Vomiting Bloody stools, especially in infants Anaphylaxis, a rare, potentially life-threatening reaction that impairs breathing and can send the body into shock Take back control of your life.  If you or your child experiences any of these symptoms, see an allergist to find a solution.  Diagnosis At your appointment, your allergist will take a detailed history, including asking what you ate, what symptoms you experienced, how long the symptoms lasted and what you did to alleviate them.  The most common allergy tests are a skin-prick test or a blood test; both look for the presence of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, which develop when your body is exposed to a substance to which it is sensitive.  These antibodies trigger the release of chemicals that cause allergic symptoms.  In the skin-prick test, a liquid containing milk or a milk protein extract is placed on your forearm or back.  Your skin is pricked with a small, sterile probe, allowing the liquid to seep into your skin. \n",

In addition, eating should be regular - portions should be little and often taken.  It is easier for the patient’s stomach to deal with a small amount of food.  What diet can be advised for the patient with acute gastritis?  The first day is better not to eat.  There could and have to be drinks, but only cool tea, mineral water without bubbles, etc.  From the second day the following can be added to the diet: liquid porridge and squashes (best is oat), liquid smashed potato with the water, soft-boiled eggs.  Such a strict diet designed for acute period of disease, in the future diet should be expanded.

Fortify staple foods with iron and other micronutrients whose deficiencies are linked with anemia.  Prevent the spread of malaria and treat the hundreds of millions with the disease.  Provide insecticide-treated bed netting to prevent parasitic infections.  Treat parasitic-worm infestations in high-risk populations.  Also, there is ongoing investigation as to whether supplying iron cookware to at-risk populations is effective in preventing and treating iron-deficiency anemia.  Key Takeaways Iron-deficiency anemia is a condition that develops from having insufficient iron levels in the body, resulting in fewer and smaller red blood cells containing lower amounts of hemoglobin.  It is diagnosed from characteristic signs and symptoms and confirmed with simple blood tests that count red blood cells and determine hemoglobin and iron content in blood.  Anemia is most often treated with iron supplements and increasing the consumption of foods that are higher in iron. \n",

Historians seem not certain who invented four wheel drive for cars.  Somehow the history of 4WD is not well recorded.  According to what I found on the internet, the first 4WD vehicle was designed by Ferdinand Porsche (yes, the founder of Porsche cars) for the Austrian truck manufacturer Jacob Lohner in 1900 (no typo).  The first vehicle in the history of 4WD had electric hub motors on each wheel - the engine powered a generator for power supply.  Porsche was 25 years old when he designed the vehicle.  By the way, NASA used the idea of electric wheel hub motors to put its lunar vehicle in motion First mechanical 4WD (transfer case, drive shafts etc.) was built by the Dutch company Jacobus Spyker in 1902.  Since the Lohner/Porsche four wheel drive has such an unusual status with its electric hub motors the Spyker is considered to be the world's first four wheel drive car.  more: spykercars.com  4WDonline.com  The world's first automaker, Daimler Benz has a solid place in 4WD history as well.

Csonka had previously designed some small vans which had been made by the large Ganz company but in 1909 he set out on his own and made a few one off cars.  In 1909 the first series production car was introduced which had a single-cylinder engine and was the first Hungarian car to have shaft drive.  This was followed in 1911 by a larger 8 hp water-cooled model.  Fourteen were made.  Most cars were built with two-seater bodies and circular radiators.   Csonka left car making in 1912 and returned to working at Budapest Technical University.  Based on the patent of Karl Benz, in 1893 Csonka and his colleague Donát Bánki improved and developed the world's first modern carburetor.   Section::::References.

A lot goes into increasing 0-60 times in performance vehicles.  As a normal rule of thumb, performance cars are considered those with 0-60 time of under 6 seconds, while Exotic cars will do 0-60 in 3 to 4 seconds.  However, in most cases, a car isn’t simply “stuck with” the acceleration number with which it was born.  Engineers and designers work tirelessly to provide better and better numbers with each progressive model of performance and exotic cars.  But, even the back yard mechanic or muscle car enthusiast can determine the 0-60 times of their cars and make moves to improve them.  The testing of acceleration is usually done on a closed course away from people other than the team that may be working on the specific car.  This limits putting anyone in danger who is not part of the test or the ongoing project.  Testers can use something as simple as a stop watch and the vehicle’s speedometer. \n",

The RC 350 goes from 0-to-60mph in a swift 5.8 seconds, though if you opt for the AWD model, that drops to 6.0 seconds.

            "Text:  The Jew in the Lotus  The Jew in the Lotus is a 1994 book by Rodger Kamenetz about a historic dialogue between rabbis and the Dalai Lama, the first recorded major dialogue between experts in Judaism and Buddhism.  The book was a popular success and became an international best-seller.  Writing in the New York Times, Verlyn Klinkenborg cited its broader relevance as a book \"about the survival of esoteric traditions in a world bent on destroying them.\"  The book was primarily potent in capturing an ongoing engagement in the US between Jews, often highly secularized, and Buddhist teachings.  Kamenetz popularized the term JUBU or Jewish Buddhist, interviewing poet Allen Ginsberg, vipassana teacher Joseph Goldstein, Ram Dass and other American Jews involved with bringing Eastern traditions to the West.  The book also made prominent a Jewish mystical response to Eastern spirituality in the Jewish renewal movement, led by Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, and Jewish meditation as taught by Rabbi Jonathan Omer-Man.  The title is a pun on the Vajrayana mantra \"Om mani padme hum\" which is frequently interpreted as \"hail to the jewel in the lotus\".   First published in 1994 by Harper San Francisco, it is now on its 37th reprint. \n",

A lot goes into increasing 0-60 times in performance vehicles.  As a normal rule of thumb, performance cars are considered those with 0-60 time of under 6 seconds, while Exotic cars will do 0-60 in 3 to 4 seconds.  However, in most cases, a car isn’t simply “stuck with” the acceleration number with which it was born.  Engineers and designers work tirelessly to provide better and better numbers with each progressive model of performance and exotic cars.  But, even the back yard mechanic or muscle car enthusiast can determine the 0-60 times of their cars and make moves to improve them.  The testing of acceleration is usually done on a closed course away from people other than the team that may be working on the specific car.  This limits putting anyone in danger who is not part of the test or the ongoing project.  Testers can use something as simple as a stop watch and the vehicle’s speedometer. \n",

At this point, the momentum which the 289 Cobras had from the 1964 racing season carried over to 1965, eventually winning the FIA World Manufactures Championship for GT cars.  Since it was already determined that Shelby was not going to have enough time to produce the 100 cars needed, the question was posed to the SCCA; what constituted the level at which the cars had to be completed?  SCCA's response was that Shelby American had the component parts on hand and if they were producing, say five cars per day, that it would fulfill the spirit of the new requirement.  As to the time limit given to get all 100 cars finished, they would be allowed 60 days past the initial deadline, that would have made it March 1, 1965, which was still before the SCCA national races began.  The other area which is a little gray is the fact that the vacant lot between the two Shelby American Venice plants was able to fit maybe 50 of the Mustang fastbacks there, but where could they put all the rest? \n",

By June of 1965, the prototype street GT350, 5S003, had served its purpose.

The batteries also produce higher output (boosting vehicle power), higher efficiency (avoiding wasteful use of electricity), and provides excellent durability, compared with the life of the battery being roughly equivalent to the life of the vehicle.   Additionally, use of lithium-ion batteries reduces the overall weight of the vehicle and also achieves improved fuel economy of 30% better than petro-powered vehicles with a consequent reduction in CO emissions helping to prevent global warming.

Level two is a faster method; existing Level 2 equipment offers charging from 208 V or 240 V (at up to 80 A, 19.2 kW).  It may require dedicated equipment and a connection installation for home or public units, although vehicles such as the Tesla have the power electronics on board and need only the outlet. \n",

The P100D reached 60 mph in just 2.2755 seconds.  No other production car, ever, has beat 2.3 seconds.  The P100D sports all-wheel drive and a 100-kWh lithium-ion battery, and it weighs in at a hefty 4,891 pounds, nearly 1,500 pounds more than the McLaren P1 ($1.15 million), 1,200 pounds more than the Porsche 918 ($845,000) and 1,400 pounds more than Ferrari’s LaFerrari ($1.7 million).  The P100D’s base price is $135,700.  Alas the three super cars pull ahead in the race to 70 and 80 mph, with the Ferrari passing the Model S at 70 mph and the others pulling away at 80 mph.  To get that performance from the car, the driver has set the software to “Ludicrous” mode. \n",

Mark McGwire confirmed rumors, admitted steroid use in 1998 season.  By JOHN BERMAN and SARAH NETTERvia January 11, 2010, 1:29 PM • 5 min read Jan. 12, 2010— -- Mark McGwire wasn't the first Major League Baseball star to admit using steroids to beef up his performance and some say he definitely won't be the last.  But at a time when sports stars once hailed as the best of the best are found apologizing in front of the camera, it seems saying \"I'm sorry\" has become a way of life in sports.  Now, McGwire is being called out not just for using steroids -- something many suspected for years -- but for claiming the drugs did not enhance his performance.  \"It has certainly rubbed people the wrong way,\" Mike Greenberg of ESPN's \"Mike & Mike in the Morning\" told \"Good Morning America\" today.  \"I would give a B- for the way he handled this,\" Greenberg said.  \"Is he sorry because he got caught and had to go public, or sorry for what he did?

First she is subjected to a strip search by a senior member, before being taken to the main hall, where the members of the program are \"motivating\" as part of their rehabilitation.  The head of the program, Hilary Navarre, asks the group if anyone knows her, and a boy called Earl admits to taking marijuana with her.

Your friend was probably prescribed Adderall to help him focus his thoughts and ignore distractions, so he can reach his full potential, but that is not happening when he gives his pills to someone else.  Teens often mistakenly believe that getting a medication by prescription means it is safe, so that it must also be safe to take for non-medical reasons or in larger doses.

In addition to antidepressants and certain heart medications called beta-blockers, specific anti-anxiety medications called benzodiazepines are often prescribed for patients with anxiety disorders.  Commonly referred to as “benzos,” they work by targeting a specific receptor in the brain called GABA.  They are usually prescribed for short-periods of time because of a risk of dependency.

Other medications for blood pressure, high cholesterol and heart attacks increased in price between three-fold and 40-fold, association data showed.  Sanders and Cummings sent letters in October to various pharmaceutical companies asking for comment about price increases and invited officials from three companies to testify at Thursday's hearing, but none of them agreed to attend, Sanders said.

The NFL's 32 clubs pay taxes on all revenues on tickets, television rights and jersey sales.  Though the potential taxes owed if these sports leagues were classified as a for-profit entity are estimated at a modest $10 million, the fact that the NFL league office is tax exempt at all is rubbing some people the wrong way anew because of the recent scandals, including the controversial player concussion issue.

The National Basketball Association has always been a for-profit business, and Major League Baseball gave up its nonprofit status back in 2007.  So the NFL should no longer be nonprofit, some sports fans fume.  This week, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., called for increasing funding for domestic violence prevention by $100 million over 10 years by taxing the dues professional sports leagues pay to support leagues' front offices.

It turns out that there are many genes that affect lifespan, but each of those genes has a very limited role.  The San Francisco researchers found that some genes make proteins that fight bacterial infections, while others ward off oxidative stress and protein damage, commonly associated with aging.But all these genes don't just do their own thing.  They are apparently controlled by at least two other genes that act as drill sergeants.  Research by these scientists found that when all these genes work right, the lifespan of the roundworm, C. elegans, doubled.  That worm is used in much research because it is a simple organism that shares many genes with humans.  But will the same thing work for humans?  Maybe.  In a related study, scientists at the University of Liverpool reported earlier this year that some proteins change over time in long living species, including humans.  Joao Pedro Magalhaes and his colleagues studied 30 mammals and found that these proteins evolve during the course of the lifetime \"to cope with biological processes impacted by aging, such as DNA damage.\"In other words, animals that live longer are better equipped to make repairs in tissues and organs that help them fight the aging process. \n",

Infants, children, adolescents, and women are the populations most at risk worldwide for iron-deficiency anemia by all causes.  In America in the past, iron-deficiency anemia was prevalent in infants and young children.  After the introduction of infant screening, fortification of formulas and foods, and educating parents on providing an iron-rich diet, iron-deficiency anemia significantly declined in this country.  In the third world, iron-deficiency anemia remains a significant public-health challenge.  Solutions to reduce the prevalence of iron-deficiency anemia in the developing world include providing supplements to target populations, fortifying foods with iron and other blood-healthy micronutrients, preventing the spread of malaria, treating parasitic infections, and giving iron cookware to high-risk populations.  The body excretes little iron and therefore the potential for accumulation in tissues and organs is considerable.  Iron accumulation in certain tissues and organs can cause a host of health problems in children and adults, including extreme fatigue, arthritis, joint pain, and severe liver and heart toxicity. \n",

It has no ethnic predisposition.  XLA is treated by infusion of human antibody.  Treatment with pooled gamma globulin cannot restore a functional population of B cells, but it is sufficient to reduce the severity and number of infections due to the passive immunity granted by the exogenous antibodies.   XLA is caused by a mutation on the X chromosome (Xq21.3-q22) of a single gene identified in 1993 which produces an enzyme known as Bruton's tyrosine kinase, or Btk.  XLA was first characterized by Dr. Ogden Bruton in a ground-breaking research paper published in 1952 describing a boy unable to develop immunities to common childhood diseases and infections.  It is the first known immune deficiency, and is classified with other inherited (genetic) defects of the immune system, known as primary immunodeficiency disorders.   Section::::Signs and symptoms.

Adults don’t always pay close attention to symptoms, which can be dangerous since crucial hints can be missed and place the adult at risk if they continue to eat the food.  Oral allergy syndrome is something that can develop in adulthood.  Also known as pollen-food syndrome, it is caused by cross-reacting allergens found in both pollen and raw fruits, vegetables, and some tree nuts.  This is not a food allergy, though the symptoms occur from food, which can be confusing.  This is a pollen allergy.  The symptoms of oral allergy syndrome are an itchy mouth or tongue, or swelling of the lips or tongue.  Symptoms are generally short-lived because the cross-reacting allergens are quickly digested, and do not involve any other part of the body.  These symptoms can help distinguish oral allergy from a true food allergy.  Can you outgrow food allergies?  Yes.  This is an important point to emphasize.  Children generally, but not always, outgrow allergies to milk, egg, soy and wheat. \n",

Answer: So, three groups of people need to seek out medical attention if they develop a cold or the flu.  The first group are those people with chronic health conditions such as asthma, emphysema, heart disease or diabetes, because their health conditions can be worsened by a cold or a flu.  The second group of people who need to seek out medical attention are people who have alarm symptoms.  People who are confused, they're dizzy, they may have difficulty breathing, things like that.  The last group of people who can seek medical attention are those who would like to get some relief from agents like Relenza or Tamiflu which can shorten the course of the flu. \n",

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it affects approximately 6 million children in the United States.  Poorly controlled and undiagnosed asthma in young kids can result in trips to the emergency room, hospital stays, missed workdays for parents and suffering that many young kids can’t express.  There are many ways an allergist can help.  The goal is for your child to feel well and live a healthy and active life.  With the care of an allergist, there is no reason your child can’t do everything they want and be as active as they choose.  Symptoms Most children with asthma have symptoms before they turn five.  The bronchial tubes – the passageways that allow air to enter and leave the lungs – in infants, toddlers and preschoolers are small and narrow.  Head colds, chest colds and other illnesses can inﬂame these airways, making them even smaller.  In very young children, it may be hard for parents, and even doctors, to recognize when symptoms are caused by asthma. \n",

The concept of using gene therapy to treat Tay-Sachs disease is to use molecular trucks (vectors also referred to as viral vectors or AAV) to transport one or more therapeutic genes into diseased cells in the brain.  Once inside the cells those vectors will direct the production of large amounts of normal Hex A enzyme, which will be distributed throughout the entire brain.  This will lead to elimination of lysosomal storage in the brain, and possibly reversal of deficits and resumption of normal neurological development.  Tay-Sachs disease is an excellent candidate for gene therapy because: Tay-Sachs is caused by mutations in a single gene (the Hex A gene). \n",

Cells have the ability to take Hex A from outside the cell and absorb it.  If we can create Hex A in the brain, the cells are adept at picking it up and using it.  The gene therapy work that is most interesting to us is that of the Tay-Sachs Gene Therapy Consortium composed of researchers from seven highly regarded academic institutions (Auburn University, Boston College, Cambridge University, NYU, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School and University of Massachusetts).  Their work as individual scientists has focused on lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) affecting the brain.  These researchers have combined their expertise with the goal of initiating a gene therapy clinical trial for Tay-Sachs disease (and Sandhoff disease) in early 2017.  The Consortium's first year of reasearch was funded entirely by private sources (include $300,00 from the CTSF) at a cost of $423,000.  But in 2009, the research team was awarded a four year $3.5 million grant from the NIH. \n",

However the main issue with this particular use is that close relatives may handle the documents, particularly when dealing with documents such as wills, and so the technique may not be appropriate.  Single-cell DNA analysis is also ideal in IVF procedures, in which single cells can be analysed for genetic defects.  However there are some major concerns with this method.  As an increased number of PCR cycles are required to amplify the DNA, this brings about problems of allele drop-in, where additional alleles are added to the sample.  Allele drop-out is a similar problem with increasing amplification samples.  When starting with a single cell or small amount of sample, any contaminants already present in the sample will be amplified.  Similarly, any PCR inhibitors present will be more concentrated, causing amplification problems.  One of the primary concerns is the ease of contamination by cells from other individuals.  This could result in samples being contaminated and rendered useless or, worse still in the case of forensics, innocent individuals being wrongly accused.  More work is required to validate the technique, particularly to use it in forensic science. \n",

            "Text: They occur during meiosis when DNA is replicated, with each SNP representing a difference in a single nucleotide. For example, a SNP may replace cytosine with a thymine in a stretch of DNA, and this will not change the length of the DNA.  There are about 10 million SNPs in the human genome, with one found at every 100-300 base pair.  These can act as biological markers.  In the analysis of SNPs, which can consist of up the four alleles, the specific base present in the SNP must be established.  This is achieved using DNA sequencing techniques.  However DNA sequencing is not generally used in forensic science except in the analysis of mitochondrial DNA.  Dideoxy Method Also known as the Sanger Method, this form of DNA sequencing was developed by Fred Sanger in 1975.  A labelled primer is utilised to initiate the synthesis of DNA.  Four dideoxy nucleotides are added and randomly arrest synthesis.  Fragments are produced which are subsequently separated using electrophoresis or, in more modern automated systems, capillary electrophoresis.  Specialised software is then used to convert the band patterns into a DNA sequence.  Initially unstable, hazardous radioactive tags were used, soon replaced by fluorescence dyes.  However the varying mobility of these different coloured dyes meant that the order of bands did not necessarily accurately represent the order of the nucleotide sequence. \n",

Biofilms in aquatic environments are often founded by diatoms.  The exact purpose of these biofilms is unknown, however there is evidence that the EPS produced by diatoms facilitates both cold and salinity stress.

New technology has furthered this trend: recombinant DNA technology allows biotechnology firms to insert DNAs into plant genomes, thereby creating plants that express the desired traits.  Use of such genetically modified organisms (GMOs) has prompted controversy, especially for its role in ensuring food security.  As such, the use of transgenics merits a serious discussion regarding its relevance to food security.  This piece discusses the purported benefits and costs of utilizing GMOs, as well as the benefits they have brought – saving land, reducing pesticide use, and promising to alleviate third world hunger.  Then we provide an in-depth analysis of the health, ecological, and socio-economic impact of transgenic organisms.  Our ultimate stance on this issue is to wait for greater availability of biotech organisms unassociated with large agricultural corporations, and for additional scientific data.  Any reference to genetically modified (GM) organisms in this piece are exclusively pointed at transgenic organisms.  We will also be examining in depth the two most widespread types of transgenic organisms: herbicide-tolerant crops and insecticide-producing plants.  Arguments for GMOs:  GMOs increase crop yields and promote efficient land use. \n",

A large proportion of the EPS is more or less strongly hydrated, however, hydrophobic EPS also occur; one example is cellulose which is produced by a range of microorganisms.  This matrix encases the cells within it and facilitates communication among them through biochemical signals as well as gene exchange.  The EPS matrix also traps extracellular enzymes and keeps them in close proximity to the cells.  Thus, the matrix represents an external digestion system and allows for stable synergistic microconsortia of different species (Wingender and Flemming, Nat.  Rev. Microbiol.  8, 623-633).  Some biofilms have been found to contain water channels that help distribute nutrients and signalling molecules.  This matrix is strong enough that under certain conditions, biofilms can become fossilized (Stromatolites). \n",

I think that certifications most often hurt great fundraisers in small shops that can’t afford official certification or formal professional development.  And I would hate to see hiring decisions being made based on certification when there are weak fundraisers out there who are certified and strong fundraisers who wouldn’t be able to get the certification.  I would hate to see fundraisers from smaller shops or international fundraisers put at a disadvantage because of a lack of certification.

Section::::Synthesis, processing and function.:Eukaryotic pre-mRNA processing.:Polyadenylation.   Polyadenylation is the covalent linkage of a polyadenylyl moiety to a messenger RNA molecule.  In eukaryotic organisms most messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules are polyadenylated at the 3' end, but recent studies have shown that short stretches of uridine (oligouridylation) are also common.  The poly(A) tail and the protein bound to it aid in protecting mRNA from degradation by exonucleases.  Polyadenylation is also important for transcription termination, export of the mRNA from the nucleus, and translation.  mRNA can also be polyadenylated in prokaryotic organisms, where poly(A) tails act to facilitate, rather than impede, exonucleolytic degradation.   Polyadenylation occurs during and/or immediately after transcription of DNA into RNA.  After transcription has been terminated, the mRNA chain is cleaved through the action of an endonuclease complex associated with RNA polymerase.  After the mRNA has been cleaved, around 250 adenosine residues are added to the free 3' end at the cleavage site.  This reaction is catalyzed by polyadenylate polymerase.  Just as in alternative splicing, there can be more than one polyadenylation variant of an mRNA.   Polyadenylation site mutations also occur. \n",

By Steven Edelman, M.D., Professor of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology and Diabetes, University of California, San Diego August 12, 2008, 11:05 AM • 3 min read — -- Question: What is the difference between type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes?  Answer: There are several types of diabetes; I'm going to discuss the two main types: type 1 and type 2.  Type 1 formerly called juvenile onset diabetes occurs typically before the age of 20.  Individuals with type 1 diabetes are usually thin, and the cause of type 1 diabetes is that the pancreas, the organ that secretes insulin, is destroyed by autoantibodies, that's why people with type 1 diabetes always need insulin, either injected or through an insulin pump.  Type 1 diabetes occurs in about 10-15 percent of all the diabetics in the country.  Now, the most common type of diabetes is what we call type 2, formerly called adult onset.  Type 2 diabetics are usually heavy, usually diagnosed after the age of 35. \n",

            "Text: Proteins that change shape when a molecule binds to it are called allosteric proteins. Catabolite Repression Another interesting point about the lac operon is that it is turned off if glucose is present even if lactose is also present.  When glucose is at low concentrations in the cell, cyclic AMP concentrations are high (figure 16.12).  Cyclic AMP binds with a protein called catabolite activator protein (CAP).  When cAMP binds with CAP, this complex then binds with part of the promoter region (figure 16.12).  This binding facilitates binding of RNA polymerase and thus increases the rate of transcription.  When glucose is high, cAMP is low and the cAMP-CAP complex is not available to bind to the promoter.  This allows the cell to use glucose as the preferred substrate and lactose is used as the glucose runs out (figure 16.12).  Mutants of the lac operon In constitutive mutants, the lac operon genes are continuously transcribed.  A mutant regulator gene (lacI -) produces a defective repressor that cannot bind to the operator.  A mutant operator region (lacO c) is defective in that the repressor cannot bind and thus transcription cannot be shut off.  Both types of mutants have the same constitutive phenotype. \n",

Dr. Hershberger answers the question: 'Spironolactone Effects On Potassium?'  By Ray Hershberger, M.D., Assoc.  Chief, Div.  of Cardiology; Dir., Heart Failure Therapies, University of Miami November 19, 2008, 3:07 PM • 1 min read — -- Question: What effects does spironolactone have on my blood potassium and should I be monitored while on it?  Answer: Because spironolactone is commonly used in heart failure treatment, its effects on your kidneys are really important.  It turns out that spironolactone causes the kidney to retain or hang on to potassium.  And it can increase the blood potassium level, and in some patients actually quite significantly, and even in a few to dangerous levels.  So with a new addition of spironolactone to your medical regimen, the blood potassium level should be monitored.  Initially the first few days after starting it, and then every couple of weeks for probably a month or two to make sure that your blood potassium levels are okay and are not too elevated. \n",

On most IF diets, very small amounts of food, or low calorie supplements, are fine to take pre-workout so long as you avoid spiking your insulin levels.  Different types of IF diets advocate different types of exercise routines and timings, with some allowing small pre-workout meals.  For instance, if you read through the “key points” on the LeanGains.com guide page, it gives a good overview of how much you should be eating depending on when you choose to workout.  It goes without saying that whatever diet you are experimenting with make sure you are staying properly hydrated.  Drinking lots of water is really important anyway, but especially important if you are limiting your calorie intake.  Similarly, if you experience any dizziness, or feel faint while you’re exercising, something isn’t right.  Stop what you’re doing, have something to eat and drink and revisit your plan. \n",

However, impairments resulting from an occupational illness or injury may not substantially limit a major life activity, or they may last only a short time, such as a few weeks with little or no impact.

The chances are far greater that you eat too much protein, especially from meat sources.  The typical Western diet includes about 100 grams of protein, while 50 grams is closer to what your body needs.  If you are healthy, with no liver or kidney problems, you can get rid of any excess with little trouble.  Yet, meat protein can be expensive and high in fat, two good reasons not to eat more than your body can use.  Beware the Dangers of a High-Protein Diet If you are looking for a quick way to lose weight, it’s easy to get fired up about a high-protein diet.  Unfortunately, the American Heart Association, the American Dietetic Association and other health organizations advise against it.  An initial drop in weight is common with a high-protein diet, but it’s due primarily to water loss.  These diets don’t work very well in the long run – nor do they build muscles as they claim.  Most important, they can be dangerous, increasing your risk of heart disease, kidney disease and artery damage, and bone loss. \n",

In addition, your allergist may prescribe epinephrine (adrenaline) in an auto-injector, to be taken in the event you develop symptoms of anaphylaxis a potentially fatal reaction that includes shortness of breath, swelling of the throat, and dizziness from a sudden drop in blood pressure.

In the skin-prick test, a small amount of a liquid containing egg protein is placed on the back or forearm, which is then pricked with a small, sterile probe to allow the liquid to seep into the skin.  If a raised, reddish spot forms within 15 to 20 minutes, that can indicate an allergy.

Kinesiotaping seels to help a little, but what can i do to get rid of this ennoying pain?  Should i fear for my marathon in 5 weeks?  Should i persist training with pain?  Thank you very much!  Christina Abbott March 1, 2014 at 2:50 pm\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReply Hi, While you’re training, use an elastic sleeve around your knee with a hole for your kneecap.  To stretch it, you’ll need another person.  Lie face down with your leg straight.  Have your assistant hold your thigh in place securely above the knee.  Turn the lower leg so the heel goes toward the midline, hold for 2 seconds, release and repeat 10 times. \n",

It haunts our past and can degrade our future.  Many people on earth don't know what causes racism, yet most of us are racist.  To give racism a smaller effect we need to find the causes and fix them.  These are six of many causes of racism.  Upbringing: Parents have a significant effect on what their child believes and what they think.  Every time the parent says or reacts harshly towards someone of a different race, they are giving their child a message that racism is the right thing to do.  Hate comes from your family and is hard to change; it can also become a part of your personality and who you are.  Peer Pressure: Your friends can have the same affect on you as your parents do.  You have chosen these people to be your friends so you are likely to listen to them.  Therefore you are more likely to agree with what they are saying about things like people from different races.  This can lead you to becoming racist.  Personal Experiences: If someone from a certain race has assaulted you, you are more likely to have fear towards people of that race. \n",

Psychosurgery has always been a controversial medical field.  The modern history of psychosurgery begins in the 1880s under the Swiss psychiatrist Gottlieb Burckhardt.  The first significant foray into psychosurgery in the twentieth century was conducted by the Portuguese neurologist Egas Moniz who during the mid-1930s developed the operation known as leucotomy.  The practice was enthusiastically taken up in the United States by the neuropsychiatrist Walter Freeman and the neurosurgeon James W. Watts who devised what became the standard prefrontal procedure and named their operative technique lobotomy, although the operation was called leucotomy in the United Kingdom.  In spite of the award of the Nobel prize to Moniz in 1949, the use of psychosurgery declined during the 1950s.  By the 1970s the standard Freeman-Watts type of operation was very rare, but other forms of psychosurgery, although used on a much smaller scale, survived.  Some countries have abandoned psychosurgery altogether; in others, for example the US and the UK, it is only used in a few centres on small numbers of people with depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).   In some countries it is also used in the treatment of schizophrenia and other disorders.   Psychosurgery is a collaboration between psychiatrists and neurosurgeons. \n",

The first systematic attempt at psychosurgery is commonly attributed to the Swiss psychiatrist Gottlieb Burckhardt.  In December 1888 Burckhardt operated on the brains of six patients (one of whom died a few days after the operation) at the Préfargier Asylum, cutting out a piece of cerebral cortex.  He presented the results at the Berlin Medical Congress and published a report, but the response was hostile and he did no further operations.

Abundant farm subsidies and high import tariffs in the developed world, most notably those set by Japan, the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy, and the United States Department of Agriculture, are thought to be the cause.  Although these subsidies and tariffs have been gradually reduced, they remain high.   Local conditions also affect exports; state over-regulation in several African nations can prevent their own exports from becoming competitive.  Research in Public Choice economics such as that of Jane Shaw suggest that protectionism operates in tandem with heavy State intervention combining to depress economic development.  Farmers subject to import and export restrictions cater to localized markets, exposing them to higher market volatility and fewer opportunities.  When subject to uncertain market conditions, farmers press for governmental intervention to suppress competition in their markets, resulting in competition being driven out of the market.  As competition is driven out of the market, farmers innovate less and grow less food further undermining economic performance.

            "Text:  Traditional African religions  The traditional African religions (or traditional beliefs and practices of African people) are a set of highly diverse beliefs that include various ethnic religions.  Generally, these traditions are oral rather than scriptural, include belief in a supreme creator, belief in spirits, veneration of the dead, use of magic and traditional African medicine.  The role of humanity is generally seen as one of harmonizing nature with the supernatural.  According to Lugira, \"it is the only religion that can claim to have originated in Africa.  Other religions found in Africa have their origins in other parts of the world.\"   Section::::Spread.   Adherents of traditional religions in Sub-Saharan Africa are distributed among 43 countries and are estimated to number over 100 million.    Although the majority of Africans are adherents of Christianity or Islam, African people often combine the practice of their traditional belief with the practice of Abrahamic religions.  The two Abrahamic religions are widespread across Africa, though mostly concentrated in different areas.  They have replaced indigenous African religions, but are often adapted to African cultural contexts and belief systems.   Section::::Ceremonies. \n",

Some castings are done using sacred divination plates made of wood or performed on the ground (often within a circle).   In traditional African societies, many people seek out diviners on a regular basis.  There are generally no prohibitions against the practice.  Diviner (also known as priest) are also sought for their wisdom as counselors in life and for their knowledge of herbal medicine.   Section::::Virtue and vice.   Virtue in traditional African religion is often connected with carrying out obligations of the communal aspect of life.  Examples include social behaviors such as the respect for parents and elders, raising children appropriately, providing hospitality, and being honest, trustworthy, and courageous.   In some traditional African religions, morality is associated with obedience or disobedience to God regarding the way a person or a community lives.  For the Kikuyu, according to their primary supreme creator, Ngai, acting through the lesser deities, is believed to speak to and be capable of guiding the virtuous person as one's conscience.  Traditionally, as now, the Kikuyu were monotheists, believing in a unique and omnipotent God whom they called Ngai. \n",

For those for whom weak paternalism is appropriate, the principle of justice supports paternalistic interventions.  Lack of decisional capacity or questionable decisional capacity counts as a morally relevant difference.  On the other hand, to behave paternalistically toward a patient who is autonomous is a serious violation of the principle of justice.  The principle of paternalism has served patients in the practice of medicine well over the years.  But as patients have become empowered by increased knowledge, the ability to have it communicated effectively, and a more refined sense of their role as patients, the principle has become largely transcended.  The result is a very positive one for both patients and physicians.  For they can now function as partners in healthcare decision-making, sharing both power and responsibility.

            "Text: Such patients may still be able to make decisions but they have no way of calculating the consequences of the decisions. The application of paternalism to situations of this type is generally recognized as appropriate.  Weak paternalism is also exercised through interventions that are undertaken when it is unclear whether the agent is autonomous or not.  To be appropriate this intervention must be time-limited.  If the agent is ultimately considered to lack decisional capacity, continuing paternalism is appropriate.  If the agent is ultimately considered to possess decisional capacity then the paternalism should cease in deference to the principle of autonomy.  Strong paternalism occurs when the liberty of a moral agent who is functionally autonomous is restricted in order to prevent self-harm and to secure a benefit for them.  Current ethical thinking judges paternalism to be inappropriate in this case.  Most codes of medical ethics support this judgement and favor the principle of autonomy in this case.  [  22] Why is paternalism generally considered inappropriate in healthcare practice?  There are two reasons why the application of the principle of paternalism has become so restricted in medical practice.  (1)  The privileged position of the physician due to the possession of special knowledge has been eroded. \n",

For those who lack decisional capacity, guardians intervene because of their special social role.  Throughout the history of medicine physicians were seen as occupying a privileged position due to their special knowledge and experience.  Thus, physicians were generally viewed as knowing what is best for their patients to a higher degree than patients who might be tempted to make the judgment for themselves.  The principle of paternalism was employed to protect moral agents from their own errors in judgment.  This was applied particularly to patients.  There was fear that patients from their limited perspective might make a decision which would bring harm to them.  For example, the refusal of a treatment might result in the continuance or increased severity of a disease.  Or they might make a decision which would foreclose the possibility of their achieving some good.  For example, the selection of a particular form of treatment might not lead to recovery, whereas one selected by the physician would lead to recovery.

The approach uses unorthodox forms of individualized testing and diagnosis to attempt to establish an etiology for each patient's specific symptoms, and claims to tailor the treatment accordingly, using a combination of nutrients, dietary changes and medications that are claimed to enhance quality of life and functionality as well as to reduce or eliminate symptoms and the use of xenobiotic drugs.  Orthomolecular psychiatry has been rejected by the mainstream medical community.   Section::::History.

Orthomolecular psychiatry's goal of weaning patients from conventional neuroleptic drugs follows \"Pfeiffer's Law\", \"For every drug that benefits a patient, there is a natural substance that can achieve the same effect\".  In 1968, Linus Pauling first used the term \"orthomolecular\".

Damascus quickly grew in dominance, eclipsing Antioch, and the Greek Patriarchate's seat was transferred there in 1342.   Both Latin and Greek Patriarchs continued to be appointed by the Pope and the Byzantine Emperor respectively during the following centuries.  However, the Latin Patriarch was a titular office, with its seat at the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome.  It continued to play a role in helping to protect various isolated Christian communities in the Near East and eventually secured their unity with Rome.

In the notation of Indian rāga, a solfege-like system called sargam is used.  As in Western solfege, there are names for the seven basic pitches of a major scale (Shadaj, Rishabh, Gandhar, Madhyam, Pancham, Dhaivat and Nishad, usually shortened Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni).  The tonic of any scale is named Sa, and the dominant Pa.  Sa is fixed in any scale, and Pa is fixed at a fifth above it (a Pythagorean fifth rather than an equal-tempered fifth).  These two notes are known as achala swar ('fixed notes').   Each of the other five notes, Re, Ga, Ma, Dha and Ni, can take a 'regular' (shuddha) pitch, which is equivalent to its pitch in a standard major scale (thus, shuddha Re, the second degree of the scale, is a whole-step higher than Sa), or an altered pitch, either a half-step above or half-step below the shuddha pitch. \n",

Unlike Western notation Byzantine neumes always indicate modal steps in relation to a clef or modal key (modal signatures which had been in use since papyrus fragments dating back to the 6th century).  Originally this key or the incipit of a common melody was enough to indicate a certain melodic model given within the echos.  Despite ekphonetic notation further early melodic notation developed not earlier than between the 9th and the 10th century.  Like the Greek alphabet notational signs are ordered left to right (though the direction could be adapted like in certain Syriac manuscripts).  The question of rhythm was entirely based on cheironomia, well-known melodical phrases given by gestures of the choirleaders, which existed once as part of an oral tradition.   Today the main difference between Western and Eastern neumes is that Eastern notation symbols are \"differential\" rather than absolute, i.e. they indicate pitch steps (rising, falling or at the same step), and the musicians know to deduce correctly, from the score and the note they are singing presently, which correct interval is meant. \n",

She changes the function or part of speech of a word; adjectives and verbs may be used as nouns; for example, in \"We talk in careless --and in loss,\" careless is an adjective used as a noun.  She frequently uses be instead of is or are.  She tends to capitalize nouns, for no apparent reason other than that they are nouns.  To casual readers of poetry, it may seem that Dickinson uses rhyme infrequently.  They are thinking of exact rhyme (for example, see, tree ).  She does use rhyme, but she uses forms of rhyme that were not generally accepted till late in the nineteenth century and are used by modern poets.  Dickinson experimented with rhyme, and her poetry shows what subtle effects can be achieved with these rhymes.  Dickinson uses identical rhyme ( sane, insane ) sparingly. \n",

Many will have to watch others being executed for trivial matters.  Inevitably, resentment and anger will form.  But they do not have the power, nor the courage, to rise against the king.  So what do they do?  They will express their voices, their anger and resentment, in the guise of silly rhyming songs meant to entertain children, according to BBC.  Like the medieval version of memes.  Of course, no one will suspect such vile messages hidden in children’s songs, right? \n",

            "Text: But all of the versions had one thing in common: they all seem to refer to a clumsy person or to someone who drinks too much alcohol. The latter speculation came from the fact that “Humpty Dumpty” meant in the 17 th century as brandy boiled with ale.  So it could mean that the clumsy person drinks too much alcohol named “Humpty Dumpty”.  Whichever the case, the nursery rhyme was clearly taken as a riddle.  Today, everyone knows the answer so well, that Humpty Dumpty took on the appearance of an egg.  Since “All the king’s horses and all the king’s men couldn’t put Humpty together again” it could be none other than an egg.  After all, nobody could fix a broken egg.  But hey, what’s with the “King’s horses” and “King’s men”?  Why should an egg be so significant as to have the king’s subjects try to put it together?  And “Great Fall”?  An egg would easily crack, even with the tiniest force.  All these stirred the curiosities of human minds, which gave way to many theories of the Humpty Dumpty nursery rhyme meaning being linked to historical events.  But there is one that seems to be getting most of the attention. \n",

Ode: usually a lyric poem of moderate length, with a serious subject, an elevated style, and an elaborate stanza pattern.There are various kinds of odes, which we don't have to worry about in an introductiory course like this.  The ode often praises people, the arts of music and poetry, natural scenes, or abstract concepts.  The Romantic poets used the ode to explore both personal or general problems; they often started with a meditation on something in nature, as did Keats in \"Ode to a Nightingale\" or Shelley in\"Ode to the West Wind.\"  Click here for a fuller discussion of the ode.  Paradox: a statement whose two parts seem contradictory yet make sense with more thought.  Christ used paradox in his teaching: \"They have ears but hear not.\"  Or in ordinary conversation, we might use a paradox, \"Deep down he's really very shallow.\"  Paradox attracts the reader's or the listener's attention and gives emphasis.

The already well established notion of Judith as an \"exemplum\" of the courage of local people against tyrannical rule from afar was given new urgency by the Assyrian nationality of Holofernes, which made him an inevitable symbol of the threatening Turks.  The Italian Renaissance poet Lucrezia Tornabuoni chose Judith as one of the five subjects of her poetry on biblical figures.    A similar dynamic was created in the 16th century by the confessional strife of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation.  Both Protestants and Catholics draped themselves in the protective mantle of Judith and cast their \"heretical\" enemies as Holofernes.   In 16th-century France, writers such as Guillaume Du Bartas, Gabrielle de Coignard and Anne de Marquets composed poems on Judith's triumph over Holofernes.  Croatian poet and humanist Marko Marulić also wrote an epic on Judith's story in 1501, the \"Judita\".  The Catholic tract \"A Treatise of Schisme\", written in 1578 at Douai by the English Roman Catholic scholar Gregory Martin, included a paragraph in which Martin expressed confidence that \"the Catholic Hope would triumph, and pious Judith would slay Holofernes\". \n",

Nigeria is the key driver of international trade in all of West Africa, which consists of sixteen countries.  Market analysts from the National Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA) claim that Nigeria accounts for over 40 percent of imports in the sub-region and ranks among Africa’s largest consumer markets.  According to Nigeria’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) (see http://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng ), imports from Asia accounted for 44.6 percent of Nigeria’s imports in 2015, while imports from Europe and the Americas accounted for 33.6 percent and 14.1 percent, respectively.  NBS reports a 24.5 percent cumulative decline in imports, more than in 2014, with imports of machinery, boilers, transport equipment, manufactured goods, and commodities dominating Nigeria’s imports from around the world. \n",

By the end of the decade, government forces gained control of the country, and the Islamic Salvation Front officially disbanded.  Smaller extremist groups continued to operate.

In January, the Tunisian president of more than twenty-three years was forced to flee to Saudi Arabia.  In Egypt, millions of protesters demonstrated in the streets against political corruption and the lack of reforms.  The revolution of Egypt’s citizens was not an armed conflict, but it was an effective protest, because it eventually brought about the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak, who had been in office for almost thirty years.  Demonstrations and protests continued against governments in Morocco and Algeria; the people voiced their concerns regarding issues such as high unemployment, poor living conditions, and government corruption.  Libya’s protests erupted into a full-scale armed revolution as antigovernment rebels took control of the city of Benghazi in an attempt to topple Muammar Gadhafi’s forty-two years of authoritarian control of the government, oil revenues, and the people.  The armed Libyan revolution was eventually successful in taking control of Tripoli and in removing Gadhafi and his family from power.

According to Poirot, the book, which received widespread media coverage, \"was considered to be the first book-length exposition of second wave radical feminist theory.\"  Published accounts of Millett's lesbianism played a part in the fracture in the feminist movement over lesbians' role within the movement and reduced her effectiveness as a women's rights activist.   Millett wrote her autobiographical books \"Flying\" (1974) and \"Sita\" (1977) about coming out as gay, partly an important consciousness-raising activity.  She realized beginning an open dialogue is important to break down the isolation and alienation that hiding in privacy can cause.  She wrote in \"Flying\" what Alice Henry calls in her \"off our backs\" review of \"Sita\" an \"excruciating public and political 'coming out'\" and its effect on her personal, political, and artistic lives.

Raised beyond the veil of slavery, a new generation of African Americans relished and preserved the stories of their ancestors who confronted the lash with dignity.  At the same time, they recognized that they were the heirs of some lesser freedom beset by prejudice and segregation.  They passed on the work songs and freedom songs of their slave ancestors, the stories of fathers and grandfathers who served in the Union army, and experiences of legions of women like Harriet Tubman who escaped from slavery in one form or another.  For many, their proud history demonstrated a path to freedom through the creation of stronger communities that might serve as a cocoon against the ugliness of the outside world.

            "Text: found that women were more easily able to perceive and categorize male faces during the more fertile phases of their menstrual cycles. Although researchers did not directly measure the presence of hormones, it is likely that phase-specific hormonal differences influenced the women’s perceptions.  At this point you can begin to see the important role the hormones play in behavior.  But the hormones we have reviewed in this section represent only a subset of the many influences that hormones have on our behaviors.  In the chapters to come we will consider the important roles that hormones play in many other behaviors, including sleeping, sexual activity, and helping and harming others.  Key Takeaways The body uses both electrical and chemical systems to create homeostasis.  The CNS is made up of bundles of nerves that carry messages to and from the PNS The peripheral nervous system is composed of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS).  The ANS is further divided into the sympathetic (activating) and parasympathetic (calming) nervous systems.  These divisions are activated by glands and organs in the endocrine system.  Specific nerves, including sensory neurons, motor neurons, and interneurons, each have specific functions.  The spinal cord may bypass the brain by responding rapidly using reflexes. \n",

And the endocrine system plays a vital role in emotions.  Because the glands in men and women differ, hormones also help explain some of the observed behavioral differences between men and women.  The major glands in the endocrine system are shown in Figure 3.20 \"The Major Glands of the Endocrine System\".

The pituitary secretes hormones that influence our responses to pain as well as hormones that signal the ovaries and testes to make sex hormones.  The pituitary gland also controls ovulation and the menstrual cycle in women.  Because the pituitary has such an important influence on other glands, it is sometimes known as the “master gland.” \n",

However, many paralegals who get the A.A. degree continue to work towards a B.A. once they have their first legal job. It isn’t such a stretch since many of them earned their A.A. degrees by going to school in the evenings.  While there are a number of us who started our paralegal careers right out of college, there are a high number of paralegal students who are pursing their second or third careers.  They are accustomed to juggling full-time employment and continued education.  I always encourage young paralegals who have not completed a B.A. to get one — it certainly is the standard in most large cities/large firms and offers the greatest options for mobility — but the BA does not necessarily need to be in paralegal studies.  An A.A. in paralegal studies with a B.A. in allmost any field of study is extremely marketable.  ESTRIN:  An A.A. used to be sufficient.

Richard Roll's critique (1977) states that this is only a theoretical concept, as to create a market portfolio for investment purposes in practice would necessarily include every single possible available asset, including real estate, precious metals, stamp collections, jewelry, and anything with any worth, as the theoretical market being referred to would be the world market.   There is some question of whether what is used for the market portfolio really matters.  Some authors say that it does not make a big difference; you can use any old index and get similar results.  Roll gave an example where different indexes produce much different results, and that by choosing the index you can get any ranking you want.  Brown and Brown examine this, using different indexes such as stocks only, stocks and bonds, and stocks plus bonds plus real estate.  They find that using a market that includes real estate produces much different results.  For example, with one measurement most mutual funds have alpha close to zero, while with another measurement most of them have significantly negative alpha. \n",

The portfolio can advance learning by providing students and/or faculty with a way to organize, archive and display pieces of work.  The electronic format allows faculty and other professionals to evaluate student portfolios using technology, which may include the Internet, CD-ROM, video, animation or audio.  Electronic portfolios are becoming a popular alternative to traditional paper-based portfolios because they offer practitioners and peers the opportunity to review, communicate and assess portfolios in an asynchronous manner.  Most people are familiar with student portfolios, however, higher education institutions are starting to create departmental and institutional portfolios as a means for evaluating student learning on a more global level.  Institutional portfolios provide a means of assessing the impact of the entire educational experience on student learning.  They can be used to drive internal improvement and external accountability.  Like student portfolios, they allow for internal improvement and external accountability, but on the level of the whole institution.

I’m also missing the radiance of my youth.  This might sound rather pathetic, but I’m sure my obsession with my appearance now has a lot to do with the nostalgia and sadness of losing that youthful bloom.  Which outfit on your site is your favorite outfit and why?  I love the outfit I wore in “ The Denim Jacket at Night ”.  It was inspired by one of my favorite designers, Coco Chanel, although there isn’t a real Chanel piece on my body or in my wardrobe for that matter.  It sums up everything I like in an outfit.  It’s simple but interesting.  It includes denim and is simultaneously glamorous and casual.  I have been amazed by your wonderful images of yourself in bikini.  It’s so refreshing to see a normal 40+ year old women pose with confidence and panache in such a revealing outfit.  How did you find the courage to do that and be so confident with your body?  I lost over 20 pounds last year and now weigh around 150 pounds.  That’s what I weighted in my twenties before I had children. \n",

In my late twenties and thirties my outfits became more conservative as I moved into a career in a large corporation, and then made a U-turn to stay at home and take care of my babies.

Here is a link to other options that are available by state.  Options that are available to all students include the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, where borrowers can have payments forgiven after 10 years in exchange for working full-time in certain public service jobs, and income-based repayment which is a new way to make paying loans more manageable where payments are calibrated to income.  Is it worthwhile for a doctor of veterinary medicine (DVM) to pursue advanced education, for example, in research?  Each situation is different.  Sometimes, greater specialization leads to higher salaries, so it would pay off.  As with any financial decision, it requires a cost-benefit analysis.  Is there a demand for that particular area of specialization? \n",

            "Text: Allergist Warner Carr, MD Dog Allergy Symptoms Do you suspect you’re suffering from dog allergies? An allergist can provide proper diagnosis and treatment.  Symptoms may include: Sneezing or a runny or stuffy nose Facial pain (from nasal congestion) Coughing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and wheezing Watery, red or itchy eyes Skin rash or hives Some people may also develop a rash or hives after being scratched or licked by a dog.  Diagnosing Dog Allergies Do you suspect you’re suffering from dog allergies?  An allergist can evaluate whether can provide proper diagnosis and treatment.  A skin-prick test is the most common way of diagnosing a dog allergy.  For this test, a small amount of an extract of dog allergen is placed on your skin.  Your skin is then pricked with a small, sterile probe, allowing the liquid to seep under the skin’s surface.  You’ll then be monitored for swelling and redness or other signs of a reaction, signaling an allergy.  Results typically become evident within 15 to 20 minutes.  Even if you’re sure your symptoms are caused by a dog, it’s a good idea to be tested, since the symptoms may actually be caused by other environmental exposures.  Dog Allergy Management and Treatment Avoidance is the best way to manage a dog allergy. \n",

            "Text: In addition to providing emotional support in various medical environments, Seizure Assistance Dogs can bring with them miracles that arise when service dogs are provided to children with disabilities. Sometimes the child who has extensive seizures must wear a helmet to protect from falls when playing on the playground, or while playing with the neighborhood kids, or during school recess.  These circumstances can, and often do, lead to isolation.  The children who lack understanding of the child’s “difference” from them often avoid the child who experiences seizures.  Even young children that have friends may find themselves left behind by their peers as they get older if the seizures limit their activities or result in cognitive delays.  However, there are few children who don’t like dogs, and the miracles that occur when children with disabilities enter the playgrounds with their service dogs is amazing.  The service dog breaks the ice.  Children will come to pet the dog, and in doing so there is an opportunity to get to know the child and understand the associated disability rather than avoiding the unknown.  Seizure Assistance Dogs are true service dogs and are allowed to go everywhere the recipient child goes as long as an adult team member is with them (someone trained to handle the dog for the child).  These dogs are task trained. \n",

There are two types of conch piercings, inner and outer.  The name is derived from the resemblance of this part of the ear to a conch (sea creature) shell.   Section::::Inner vs Outer Conch.   The inner conch piercing is located at the center of the ear, the cup-shaped area adjacent to the ear canal.  An outer conch piercing is positioned in the flat portion of the ear between the rim/edge (helix) and the ridge that defines the antihelix.  Both piercings are performed in much the same manner as other ear cartilage piercings and cared for in the same way as well.   Section::::Procedure.   The piercings are made using a hollow, hypodermic needle, typically around 14g or slightly larger.  Most piercers agree that 16g should be the lowest limit for a healthy piercing.  Once the hole has been made, straight or curved barbells are most often used during healing, although larger diameter CBRs (captive bead ring) are used as well.

Outdoor cats face considerable danger from vehicle traffic, as well as harassment from larger animals, such as dogs and coyotes.  We think these threats are responsible for a much greater share of mortality than raptors.  In addition, outdoor cats are responsible for killing millions of wild birds every year.  Turnabout may not seem fair play when it comes to a raptor threatening our beloved cat, but by allowing our cats to roam free, we are exposing them to this uncommon danger.

Grapefruit, Medicine Interaction Warning Expanded By ABC News November 26, 2012 Image credit: Johner/Getty Images ABC News' Ben Maas reports: It has long been known that grapefruit juice can pose dangerous - and even deadly - risks when taken along with certain medications.  Now, experts warn the list of medications that can result in these interactions is longer than many may have believed.  Check below to see whether your medication appears on the list.  In a new report released Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, researchers at the University of Western Ontario said that while 17 drugs were identified in 2008 as having the potential to cause serious problems when taken with grapefruit, this number has now grown to 43. \n",

            "Text: Left un-checked, your yard can quickly turn into a mine field of feces in a week or less. On average, dogs do a number two twice per day which adds up to about 14 piles of poo in just one week, per dog.  Contrary to popular belief, dog feces is not fertilizer and does not provide any benefit to the soil.  So whats in it?  Dog feces may contain parvovirus, whipworms, hookworms, roundworms, threadworms, campylobacteriosis, giardia, and coccidia.  If left unattended, these parasites will contaminate the water, soil, and can even cause infection in both pets and humans (especially children).  The microscopic Hookworm larvae can be passed to another pet or person directly through the skin or by accidental ingestion as can other bacteria.  Which parasites can humans acquire?  Yes, humans are capable of contracting hookworms, tapeworms, threadworms and campylobacteriosis.  This is the most significant reason to avoid allowing dogs (especially puppies) to like your face and mouth - affectionately known as \"puppy kisses\".  If a dog has recently eaten feces or attempted to groom their hind quarters and come into contact with this infectious material, there is a chance the parasites will be passed directly into your mouth. \n",

Getty Images — -- A rare epidemic of canine flu is spreading throughout the Chicago area, veterinary experts warned.  In an advisory issued by the Cook County Department of Animal and Rabies Control, officials said more than 1,000 cases had been identified over the past month and five dogs have died from the disease.  The Chicago Park District began posting warning signs at dog parks last week advising dog owners to keep their pets away from any place where there is close contact with other dogs, a spokeswoman for the organization said.  Over the weekend the group canceled their annual doggy Easter egg hunt held at a local dog park to prevent the spread of the illness. \n",

About The Parvo Vaccine…… Vaccinating your puppy against parvo virus is the best protection you can give him.

You can read more about the timing of vaccinations, and why one or two rounds of puppy shots doesn’t mean that your pup is fully protected, on my Puppy Vaccinations page.  Because of this, it’s vital never to allow your Rottweiler puppy to come in contact with unvaccinated puppies or dogs or areas where stray or unvaccinated dogs may have been until he’s had at least 3 Parvo vaccinations (and preferably 4)!  The incubation period (time between exposure & symptoms) is between 3 and 14 days.  Most pups show signs quickly, within a couple of days of being exposed, but others may take up to two weeks to become symptomatic.  The virus is often found in the feces of infected pups several days prior to any symptoms appearing.  It is also present for at least 2 weeks after the puppy has completely recovered. \n",

For instance, the owner begins to notice that every time the puppy runs in circles, they then proceed to “Go potty.”  Eventually, the owner will let the puppy outside immediately after observing this behavior and no further accidents occur in the home.  This is the same principle as understanding how dogs alert to seizures.  If the dog is able to make the connection between the chemical changes he senses and the occurrence of seizures, he may begin to act in a certain way when these changes begin.  For example, they may come and stare at the owner, or they may begin barking and/or even nipping at their owners.  Eventually people who seize realize that every time their dog barks madly and nips at them they will have a seizure and they will begin to prepare themselves for the seizure before it actually starts. \n",

A look back at the mystery and motivation behind \"King of Pop's\" metamorphosis.  By JON MEYERSOHN, CYNTHIA McFADDEN and<br> TOM MCCARTHY July 1, 2009, 3:56 PM • 7 min read July 3, 2009 -- For all his towering influence as a recording artist, Michael Jackson lives in the popular consciousness not only as a huge talent but as a shadowy figure of intense self-conflict, a man who spent his career in flight from his audience, the world, himself.  \"Man in the Mirror\" was more than a hit song for Jackson.  It was a reflection of a bizarre and enthralling series of identities, all of them written -- and rewritten, and rewritten -- on the star's face.  The question of what drove Jackson to so radically alter his appearance gradually came to rival, if not overshadow, his brilliance as a performer.  \"He didn't want to be Michael Joseph Jackson,\" said J. Randy Taraborrelli, who has followed Jackson's career for three decades and wrote an unauthorized biography.  \"He just wanted to be something else.  And he went about the business of doing that.\" \n",

With reports from Jackson's autopsy documenting his weight at the time of his death yet to be released, there has thus far been no solid evidence that Jackson was suffering from an eating disorder.  But that has not stopped the media from raising such a possibility following his death on June 25.  Some of those who were close to the star said that his eating habits did not point to the presence of an eating disorder -- at least not in the traditional sense.  \"He was just careful about what he ate; he just tried to be healthy,\" said Kevin McLin, a friend of the family and Jackson's former publicist.  \"He ate turkey burgers, Chinese food, a lot of vegetables.

By JON MEYERSOHN, CYNTHIA McFADDEN and<br> TOM MCCARTHY July 1, 2009, 3:56 PM • 7 min read July 3, 2009 -- For all his towering influence as a recording artist, Michael Jackson lives in the popular consciousness not only as a huge talent but as a shadowy figure of intense self-conflict, a man who spent his career in flight from his audience, the world, himself.  \"Man in the Mirror\" was more than a hit song for Jackson.  It was a reflection of a bizarre and enthralling series of identities, all of them written -- and rewritten, and rewritten -- on the star's face.  The question of what drove Jackson to so radically alter his appearance gradually came to rival, if not overshadow, his brilliance as a performer.  \"He didn't want to be Michael Joseph Jackson,\" said J. Randy Taraborrelli, who has followed Jackson's career for three decades and wrote an unauthorized biography.  \"He just wanted to be something else.

On Wednesday, Dr. Arnie Klein, Jackson's physician, told \"Good Morning America\" that he had diagnosed Jackson, 50, with lupus, a disease in which the body comes under attack from its own immune system.  The result is inflammation, pain and damage to certain tissues of the body.  Hints of how Jackson dealt with such a condition can be found in his personal style choices, from the surgical mask he occasionally donned to his signature white glove.  According to the Lupus Foundation of America, at least at least 1.5 million Americans have lupus, and about 5 million people throughout the world have some form of the disease. \n",

It was originally planned to be a fully paved highway 5200 kilometers long.  However, these plans were modified following its inauguration.   In particular, because of high construction costs and in the late 1970s, only a part of the highway was paved, from its beginning to 200 km ahead of Marabá.

A large scale drought in Bihar was adverted due to this import, although livestock and crops were destroyed.

            "Text: European colonialism impacted Middle America in more ways than language and religion. Before Christopher Columbus arrived from Europe, the Americas did not have animals such as horses, donkeys, sheep, chickens, and domesticated cattle.  This meant there were no large draft animals for plowing fields or carrying heavy burdens.  The concept of the wheel, which was so prominent in Europe, was not found in use in the Americas.  Food crops were also different: the potato was an American food crop, as were corn, squash, beans, chili peppers, and tobacco.  Europeans brought other food crops—either from Europe itself or from its colonies—such as coffee, wheat, barley, rice, citrus fruits, and sugarcane.  Besides food crops, building methods, agricultural practices, and even diseases were exchanged.  The Spanish invasion of Middle America following Columbus had devastating consequences for the indigenous populations.  It has been estimated that fifteen to twenty million people lived in Middle America when the Europeans arrived, but after a century of European colonialism, only about 2.5 million remained.  Few of the indigenous peoples—such as the Arawak and the Carib on the islands of the Caribbean and the Maya and Aztec on the mainland—had immunities to European diseases such as measles, mumps, smallpox, and influenza. \n",

From 1764 onwards, there was a gradual change from a slave-based society to one based on production for domestic consumption and export.  Following the independence of Brazil in 1822, the slave trade was formally abolished in 1836.  However it did continue locally into the 20th century.  In 1844, Angola's ports were opened to foreign shipping.   By 1850, Luanda was one of the greatest and most developed Portuguese cities in the vast Portuguese Empire outside of Mainland Portugal, full of trading companies, exporting peanut oil, copal, timber, and cocoa.  The principal exports of the post-slave economy in the 19th century were rubber, beeswax, and ivory.  Maize, tobacco, dried meat and cassava flour also began to be locally produced.  Prior to the First World War, exportation of coffee, palm kernels and oil, cattle, leather and hides, and salt fish joined the principal exports, with small quantities of gold and cotton also being produced.  Grains, sugar, and rum were also produced for local consumption.  The principal imports were foodstuffs, cotton goods, hardware, and British coal.

In 2014, Poland was the world's largest mushroom exporter, reporting an estimated annually.   Separating edible from poisonous species requires meticulous attention to detail; there is no single trait by which all toxic mushrooms can be identified, nor one by which all edible mushrooms can be identified.  People who collect mushrooms for consumption are known as mycophagists, and the act of collecting them for such is known as mushroom hunting, or simply \"mushrooming\".  Even edible mushrooms may produce allergic reactions in susceptible individuals, from a mild asthmatic response to severe anaphylactic shock.  Even the cultivated \"A. bisporus\" contains small amounts of hydrazines, the most abundant of which is agaritine (a mycotoxin and carcinogen).  However, the hydrazines are destroyed by moderate heat when cooking.   A number of species of mushrooms are poisonous; although some resemble certain edible species, consuming them could be fatal.  Eating mushrooms gathered in the wild is risky and should only be undertaken by individuals knowledgeable in mushroom identification.  Common best practice is for wild mushroom pickers to focus on collecting a small number of visually distinctive, edible mushroom species that cannot be easily confused with poisonous varieties. \n",

The company said it expects the average receipt to increase by 1 percent and that fewer than 20 percent of customers will be affected.  R.J. Hottovy, senior restaurants analyst with Morningstar, said that the timing of the price increase seems a bit surprising on the surface, as coffee bean prices have generally come down in recent months.  But when factoring in the other investments the company has been making the past months, the timing makes more sense, he said.  This is true \"particularly on the labor front,\" where the company has been raising wages for partners and shift supervisors, adding a food benefit program, developing new partner apps for viewing work schedules, on top of other efforts such as tuition reimbursement and health care benefits.  \"I suspect there will be little pushback from Starbucks customers, especially as we see increased penetration from mobile ordering in the back half of the year -- where prices aren't as transparent,\" Hottovy said. \n",

These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop.  Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide.  With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays.  In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides.  Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.   Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium \"Bacillus thuringiensis\" (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects.  These crops resist damage by insects.  Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination with wild species.  In some cases, wild species are the primary source of resistance traits; some tomato cultivars that have gained resistance to at least 19 diseases did so through crossing with wild populations of tomatoes. \n",

Bt crops may still be better than their alternatives in that they represent an overall decrease in ecological damage caused by pesticides.  Still, the rise of such insects demonstrates the unknowns involved in shifting over to transgenic crops.  Unknown long-term ecological effects make transgenics less palatable, especially in regions with great biodiversity.  The development of herbicide resistant plants has also led to an unexpected increase in the resilience of weeds, which threatens to create a cycle of dependence.  The introduction of such herbicide tolerant plants at first decreased herbicide use, but afterwards increased its usage and scope.  Weeds have become more and more resistant to herbicides, prompting farmers to use a wider variety and larger quantity of them (Lim).  While pesticide use dropped from 22,454 lbs to 15,618 lbs from 2003 to 2008, at a rate of 7000 lbs per acre per year, herbicide use increased from 278,514,000 lbs to 330,422,709 lbs (Cherry).  Thus, the sum of herbicide and pesticide usage per hectare in the United States increased 10 percent since 2003 (Cherry). \n",

Elijah Cummings announced they were investigating why some generic drug prices have risen hundreds to thousands of percent -- putting a severe strain on the pocketbooks of many people who rely on generics to reduce costs compared to brand-name drugs.  To combat the rising prices, Sanders said he was introducing a bill that would require generic drug makers to pay a rebate to Medicaid if the cost increases faster than inflation.  The prices of more than 1,200 generic medications increased an average of 448 percent between July 2013 and July 2014, Sanders said during the hearing, citing federal records. \n",

The Democratic party has never been perfectly unified.  In this year’s Democratic primary, disagreements among registered Democrats seemed especially acute.  Approximately 12 million Americans voted for former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, versus the 15.8 million who voted for nominee Hillary Clinton.  Some portion of voters who supported Sanders in the primary will likely either not vote, or cast a ballot for a third-party candidate.  Yet, the country’s two-party political system is so structurally entrenched that the majority of states that went for Democratic candidate Barack Obama in 2012 appear likely to go for Clinton this time as well.  While the political platform of a party and the candidates within that party can change over time, it seems that a portion of the population will always vote Republican or Democrat no matter who is running for president.

She attributed much of her success in weightlifting to chiropractic because it steered her away from painkillers and towards drug-free and non-surgical forms of treatment and prevention, she said in an interview.  She explained her decision to become a chiropractor allowed her to \"stay involved in health and fitness, while at the same time being able to use my knowledge and experience to help other people.\" \n",

            "Text:  Electric Fields A Electric Fields    As you already know, electric charges exert forces on each other.  Imagine that you have a set of charges --- some big, some small, some positive, some negative --- scattered around.  Now imagine that you have a small test charge that you can move around, and at many places you stop and measure the force exerted on the test charge by all the other charges.  The force felt by that test charge is the vector sum (i.e. the resultant) of the forces exerted on it by each individual charge.  This is called the principle of superposition.  Here are some diagrams to illustrate this concept.  Red circles represent positive charges; black circles are negative.  The test charge is positive, and drawn smaller than the others.  In this first diagram, both charges are negative, and so both attract the test charge.  Because they are in opposite directions, however, the resultant (net) force is zero.  If we now make both the big charges positive, the forces become repulsive.  They are still in opposite directions, however, so the net force is still zero.  Below, the test charge is repelled from the positive charge and attracted to the negative charge. \n",

But when it's out of control—as in rheumatoid arthritis—it can damage the body.  Plus, it's thought to play a role in obesity, heart disease, and cancer.

Time your meals – If you are on a fast that isn’t zero calories, then try to eat before, or immediately after your workout.  This will ensure that you have some energy to workout, or allow you to replenish your energy stores and aid recovery post workout.  On most IF diets, very small amounts of food, or low calorie supplements, are fine to take pre-workout so long as you avoid spiking your insulin levels.  Different types of IF diets advocate different types of exercise routines and timings, with some allowing small pre-workout meals.  For instance, if you read through the “key points” on the LeanGains.com guide page, it gives a good overview of how much you should be eating depending on when you choose to workout.  It goes without saying that whatever diet you are experimenting with make sure you are staying properly hydrated.  Drinking lots of water is really important anyway, but especially important if you are limiting your calorie intake.  Similarly, if you experience any dizziness, or feel faint while you’re exercising, something isn’t right.  Stop what you’re doing, have something to eat and drink and revisit your plan. \n",

Some people have stomachs of steel and you can literally eat your meal, go out, do your workout, go out, do your swim, without cramping up.  So you want to experiment and you want to experiment in an environment when it doesn't really matter.  You don't want to go out for that long run if you've never experimented with that before.  So try it first to know if you do start to cramp up you can immediately turn around, come back home, but it's all gonna be very individual.

Check out this article on Medical News Today for more of the science behind these benefits.  Side Effects of Intermittent Fasting Staying properly hydrated is really important while fasting Stress – In direct contrast to the point on improved mood above, the initial challenge of limiting your calorie intake to such an extreme extent can put a strain on your will power and increase your stress levels.  Dehydration – Research has shown that many people experience dehydration while fasting, most likely as a result of not making up for the liquid that would usually have been consumed through food.  It is therefore especially important that you increase your water intake on fast days to make up for this.

Health Benefits of Fasting Some of the key benefits to intermittent fasting include: Weight loss – One of the most noticeable benefits and the reason that most people experiment with intermittent fasting is rapid weight loss.  Limiting your calorie intake to well below your BMR means that over even a short period of time you will notice an impressive drop in weight.  Detox – Reducing calorie intake forces your body to burn fat reserves for energy.  During this process, toxins that were stored in the fat are broken down and expelled.

Popular Modern Fasting Diets In recent years four popular methods of intermittent fast have emerged.  Many forms of intermittent fasting restrict eating to certain time windows LeanGains – Fasting for a set number of hours each day (Men – 16 hours, Women – 14 hours) during which you consume zero calories.  Eat Stop Eat – This involves fasting for a full 24 hour period once or twice a week.  On your fast days you consume zero calories but are allowed drinks such as water and black coffee.  5:2 Diet – For five days each week you eat normally, and on the other two days you cut your calorie intake down to 600 calories (men) or 500 calories (women).  ADF fasting – Alternate Day fasting is similar to the 5:2 Diet but more intense.  As the name suggests, you eat normally on alternate days, and fast on the days in between.  On the fast days you should cut your calorie intake to roughly 500 calories.  While this is potentially more difficult to stick to, there are still many alternate day fasting success stories around. \n",

Sea Floor Spreading - Magnetic mapping of the ocean floor revealed a history of polarity reversals that formed a mirror image about the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  This indicates that the floor of the Atlantic Ocean is created at the mid Atlantic ridge due to crustal separation.  As magma issues forth and solidifies, it records the orientation of the earth's magnetic field at the time of solidification.  These newly formed rocks are then carried either East or West of the Mid-Ocean ridge.  The floor of the Atlantic Ocean is thus an Age sequence with newly formed rock appearing at the Mid Atlantic Ridge and the oldest rocks being at the North American and European Coastlines.  The time of transport from the mid Atlantic ridge to these coastlines is about 210 million years which indicates a total sea floor motion of about 1.5 inches per year. \n",

In the theory of plate tectonics the outermost part of the Earth's interior is made up of two layers, the outer lithosphereand the inner asthenosphere.  The lithosphere essentially \"floats\" on the asthenosphere and is broken-up into ten major plates: African, Antarctic, Australian, Eurasian, North American, South American, Pacific, Cocos, Nazca, and the Indianplates.  These plates (and the more numerous minor plates) move in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries: convergent (two plates push against one another), divergent (two plates move away from each other), and transform (two plates slide past one another).  Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trenchformation occur along plate boundaries (most notably around the so-called \"Pacific Ring of Fire\").

Within a matter of only several years geophysicsand geology in particular were revolutionized.  The parallel is striking: just as pre-Copernican astronomy was highly descriptive but still unable to provide explanations for the motions of celestial objects, pre-tectonic plate geological theories described what was observed but struggled to provide any fundamental mechanisms.  The problem lay in the question \"How?\".  Before acceptance of plate tectonics, geology in particular was trapped in a \"pre-Copernican\" box.  However, by comparison to astronomy the geological revolution was much more sudden.  What had been rejected for decades by any respectable scientific journal was eagerly accepted within a few short years in the 1960sand 1970s.  Any geological description before this had been highly descriptive.  All the rocks were described and assorted reasons, sometimes in excruciating detail, were given for why they were where they are.  The descriptions are still valid.  The reasons, however, today sound much like pre-Copernican astronomy.  One simply has to read the pre-plate descriptions of why the Alpsor Himalayaexist to see the difference. \n",

It's in the Air By ABC News October 18, 2006, 4:10 AM • 4 min read Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Email this article Oct. 18, 2006 — -- Before dinosaurs and birds came on the scene, dragonflies were king, with wingspans of about two and a half feet.  That was 300 million years ago, during the late Paleozoic period.  Despite all the changes that have taken place since then, dragonflies are still around.  Fortunately, they're much smaller.  For more than a decade now, scientists have been trying to figure out why the giant insects that roamed the planet so long ago are all gone, replaced by the smaller ones we see today.  Predation by the first birds?  Perhaps.  But new research suggests that the answer lies in the air, and if we could somehow tweak the atmosphere and pump up the oxygen, those big babies could be back.  The late Paleozoic was a time of huge trees, and giant ferns, many of which became buried in the soil, forming future hydrocarbon deposits, says Jon Harrison, an environmental physiologist at Arizona State University in Tempe and the principal investigator in an experiment described recently during a meeting of the American Physiological Society. \n",

In 1969, John Ostrom described \"Deinonychus antirrhopus\", a theropod that he had discovered in Montana in 1964 and whose skeletal resemblance to birds seemed unmistakable.  Ostrom became a leading proponent of the theory that birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs.  Further comparisons of bird and dinosaur skeletons, as well as cladistic analysis strengthened the case for the link, particularly for a branch of theropods called maniraptors.  Skeletal similarities include the neck, the pubis, the wrists (semi-lunate carpal), the 'arms' and pectoral girdle, the shoulder blade, the clavicle and the breast bone.  In all, over a hundred distinct anatomical features are shared by birds and theropod dinosaurs.  Other researchers drew on these shared features and other aspects of dinosaur biology and began to suggest that at least some theropod dinosaurs were feathered.

Shortly after the 1859 publication of Charles Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\", British biologist Thomas Henry Huxley proposed that birds were descendants of dinosaurs.  He compared the skeletal structure of \"Compsognathus\", a small theropod dinosaur, and the 'first bird' \"Archaeopteryx lithographica\" (both of which were found in the Upper Jurassic Bavarian limestone of Solnhofen).  He showed that, apart from its hands and feathers, \"Archaeopteryx\" was quite similar to \"Compsognathus\".  Thus \"Archaeopteryx\" represents a transitional fossil.  In 1868 he published \"On the Animals which are most nearly intermediate between Birds and Reptiles\", making the case.  The first restoration of a feathered dinosaur was Thomas Henry Huxley's depiction in 1876 of a feathered \"Compsognathus\" to accompany a lecture on the evolution of birds he delivered in New York in which he speculated that the aforementioned dinosaur might have been in possession of feathers.

Due to these similarities and through developmental research, many scientists believe that feathers have only evolved once in dinosaurs.  Feathers would then have been passed down to all later, more derived species, unless some lineages lost feathers secondarily.  If a dinosaur falls at a point on an evolutionary tree within the known feather-bearing lineages, then its ancestors had feathers, and it is quite possible that it did as well.  This technique, called phylogenetic bracketing, can also be used to infer the type of feathers a species may have had, since the developmental history of feathers is now reasonably well-known.

The fossils were preserved in a Lagerstätte—a sedimentary deposit exhibiting remarkable richness and completeness in its fossils—in Liaoning, China.  The area had repeatedly been smothered in volcanic ash produced by eruptions in Inner Mongolia 124 million years ago, during the Early Cretaceous epoch.  The fine-grained ash preserved the living organisms that it buried in fine detail.  The area was teeming with life, with millions of leaves, angiosperms (the oldest known), insects, fish, frogs, salamanders, mammals, turtles, and lizards discovered to date.

            "Text: Poison Dart Frog Appearance One of the adaptations these frogs are famous for is their brightly colored skin. This skin serves as a warning to predators about their extremely toxic secretions.  The term for creatures that have bright coloration to warn predators that they are toxic is called “aposematic coloration.”  The different species come in a rainbow of colors, including blue, yellow, red, green, golden, and black.  The strawberry poison dart frog is one of the species’ most poisonous members and has a bright red body with blue legs.  The golden poison dart frog is also especially dangerous and has enough toxin to kill over 20,000 mice.  It is also the largest of the poison dart frog species.  However, the facts are that not all members of the poison dart frog family are poisonous, or brightly colored.  Some humble species come in shades of tan and brown, and these species are usually not toxic to most animals.  These frogs tend to be small, with the average length being around 1 inch.  Like most frog species, their skin is smooth and damp, and they have webbed toes.  Poison Dart Frog Behavior Some facts about these frogs’ behavior include that they like to live in the trees closest to the ground, or the leaf litter of the jungle floor. \n",

            "Text: Darwin’s Frog Predators and Threats The biggest threats to Darwin’s Frogs are the fungus chytrid, which causes an infectious disease called chytridiomycosis. This fungal infection is capable of killing more frogs, more quickly than its natural predators or humans.  Scientists do not know the origin of the bacteria responsible for this fungal infection.  But it is believed to have wiped out the entire population of the northern Darwin’s Frog species of northern Chile.  This means only the southern population of Darwin’s Frogs remain in southern Chile and Argentina.  Southern Darwin’s Frogs also face the ongoing threats of animal predators.  These include rodents, snakes, and birds.  When a predator is near, the Darwin’s Frog uses its coloring to help it hide from the animal.  By laying very still on the forest floor, the frog blends in with its surroundings.  The predators only see what looks like another dead leaf on the ground.  The frogs also drop or jump into a stream and float like a leaf down the river.  Humans threaten the Darwin’s Frog habitat through urbanization.  Deforestation and encroaching cities take habitat from the frogs for human use.  Other threats are results of climate change: changing temperatures and increased sun UV exposure can kill the frogs.  The northern Darwin’s frog is believed to be extinct. \n",

            "Text: It mainly preys on the largest and most toxic species, the golden poison dart frog, which has enough toxins in its skin to immobilize ten human beings. Can a poison dart frog kill you?  Some species of frog, such as the strawberry poison dart frog, produce toxins in their skin.  Strawberry poison dart frogs tend to irritate only when they come into contact with human skin.  However, it could be fatal if ingested or if it enters the body through a wound.  This fact is where poison dart frogs get their names – indigenous tribes would smear the frogs’ toxins on to darts and arrows and use them for defense or hunting.  The dart or arrow would cause a wound in the skin, and the poison would enter and kill the victim.  Can you touch a poison dart frog?  It depends on the species of frog.  Some species are harmless to humans, and others may only cause minor irritation when handled.  It is crucial to make sure that one does not have any cuts or open wounds when holding potentially toxic species.  It also depends on the frog’s diet.  Wild poison dart frogs eat insects that contribute to their toxicity.  In captivity, most frogs do not have the appropriate diets to generate poisonous toxins in their skin. \n",

            "Text: The first line of defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce. This keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip.  The secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic.  Snakes have been observed yawning and gaping when trying to swallow African clawed frogs (\"Xenopus laevis\"), which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape.  Caecilians have been little studied in this respect, but the Cayenne caecilian (\"Typhlonectes compressicauda\") produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in a feeding experiment in Brazil.  In some salamanders, the skin is poisonous.  The rough-skinned newt (\"Taricha granulosa\") from North America and other members of its genus contain the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX), the most toxic non-protein substance known and almost identical to that produced by pufferfish.  Handling the newts does not cause harm, but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the skin is deadly.  In feeding trials, fish, frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible.  The only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of common garter snake (\"Thamnophis sirtalis\"). \n",

The struggles of the prey and further jaw movements work it inwards and the caecilian usually retreats into its burrow.  The subdued prey is gulped down whole.   When they are newly hatched, frog larvae feed on the yolk of the egg.  When this is exhausted some move on to feed on bacteria, algal crusts, detritus and raspings from submerged plants.  Water is drawn in through their mouths, which are usually at the bottom of their heads, and passes through branchial food traps between their mouths and their gills where fine particles are trapped in mucus and filtered out. \n",

It was here that he became fascinated, to the point of obsession, with tessellation, explaining:  The sketches he made in the Alhambra formed a major source for his work from that time on.  He also studied the architecture of the Mezquita, the Moorish mosque of Cordoba.  This turned out to be the last of his long study journeys; after 1937, his artworks were created in his studio rather than in the field.  His art correspondingly changed sharply from being mainly observational, with a strong emphasis on the realistic details of things seen in nature and architecture, to being the product of his geometric analysis and his visual imagination. \n",

It can be found commercially produced and packaged but is often prepared at home based on family recipes.  Most recipes will also contain varying amounts of salt, smoked meat, and spices.  The consistency of the mixture ranges from large grains the size of cracked bulgur wheat or couscous down to a table-salt-sized powder.  Most \"farofas\" have a very smoky and slightly salty taste, by and large used to accentuate the taste of meat, particularly barbecued meat and hearty stews.   In Brazil, where \"farofa\" is particularly popular, typical recipes call for raw cassava flour to be toasted with vegetable oil or olive oil, salt, bacon, onions, garlic, sausage, olives, hard-boiled eggs until golden brown.  It is an essential accompaniment to \"feijoada\" and Brazilian barbecue.  In Brazil, farofa is also used in a stuffing for poultry and other dishes, usually containing raisins, nuts, and/or finely chopped sweet fruits like apples and bananas.  In the state of Bahia, it is common for farofa to be prepared with dendê oil, giving it a stronger taste and a rich yellow coloring. \n",

He was born in Carona, Ticino, and apprenticed under his father Guiniforte Solari, himself an architect and sculptor.  In 1476, he was hired to continue the construction of the Duomo di Milano.  Later on, he was in charge of several construction projects in Milan.  In 1484 he sculpted a tomb in the Cathedral of Alessandria.   In 1487, he was invited to Russia by Ivan III to construct the walls and towers of the Moscow Kremlin.  Within the next two years, Solari built most of the walls (excluding the western wall built by his successor Aleviz) and towers of the Kremlin, including the Borovitskaya, Konstantino-Eleninskaya, Spasskaya, Nikolskaya, and Corner Arsenalnaya towers.

            "Text: The economic growth and the financial development grew throughout the Renaissance along with the political power of self-governing cities. The location of Italy was a great factor of the economic and political developments.  It was surrounded by water which made it an ideal place for trade.  The merchants began to make a lot of money from trading, so some wealthy merchant families would invest some of their money from trade into to banks.  Which they would make profits from loans, investments, and money exchanges of the people in Italy.  2)  There were three key ideas that were described to be very important of the Renaissance.  These ideas were humanism, individualism, and secularism.  Humanism was the study of humans and their talents or what they were capable of.  Individualism focused more on individual’s personalities and uniqueness, along with their intelligence and capabilities.  Secularism was concerned the material world rather that the spiritual word.  None of these ideas affected woman as they did man.  3)Art was the most admired feature of the Renaissance.  In the Middle ages art was just to teach religion, but towards the Renaissance the art began to be made not just for learning.  Many rich people would sponsor artists to raise their “status” and have sculptures and paintings made of them and, or, their families. \n",

            "Text: Italian city states such as Venice grew rich through overseas trade and Florence also possessed enormous wealth. They made advances in building their ships and Genoa and Milan earned benefits of trade with the Middle East and northerm Europe.  They had great geographical positions as natural crossroads for trade.  New ideas and cultures were brought from trade which provided the setting for the Renaissance.  2  .  The key ideas of the Renaissance were individualism, humanism, and secularism.  They were different for men and for women because women were treated as unequals to men at the time.  Secularism was stressed more in southern Europe and northern Europe was focused more on religion.  3. Changes in art reflected and shaped new ideas during the Renaissance.  Art revealed power and changing patterns of consumption and paintings displayed wealth.  Portraits now mirrored reality instead of a spiritual idea.  Realism, narrative power, the use of light and dark, rich color, decorative detail, curvilinear rhthyms, swaying forms, and the use of perspective in paintings was developed.  4.  The primary social hierachies in Renaissance Europe were made up of the low class, the middle class, which is also referred to as the popolo, and the upper class.  This shaped people's lives because you did not get to choose what class you belonged to. \n",

Human activity and hydrographs Man-made impermeable materials such as concrete cover a large proportion of the soil in urban areas.  Due to this water is unable to infiltrate the soil, surface runoff is increased and water reaches the rivers faster.  This leads to a shorter lag time and an increase in peak discharge.  Because water enters man-made drainage systems before it can infiltrate the soil or evaporate on its way to the river, man-made drainage systems affect hydrographs in a similar way and result in a shorter lag time and increased peak discharge.

Animal husbandry is also responsible for greenhouse gas production of and a percentage of the world's methane, and future land infertility, and the displacement of wildlife.  Agriculture contributes to climate change by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases, and by the conversion of non-agricultural land such as forest for agricultural use.  Agriculture, forestry and land-use change contributed around 20 to 25% to global annual emissions in 2010.  A range of policies can reduce the risk of negative climate change impacts on agriculture, and greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector.   Section::::Environmental impact.:Sustainability.   Current farming methods have resulted in over-stretched water resources, high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility.  There is not enough water to continue farming using current practices; therefore how critical water, land, and ecosystem resources are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered.

Stormwater ponds also collect suspended sediments, which are often found in high concentrations in stormwater water due to upstream construction and sand applications to roadways.   Section::::Design features.   Storm water is typically channeled to a retention basin through a system of street and/or parking lot storm drains, and a network of drain channels or underground pipes.  The basins are designed to allow relatively large flows of water to enter, but discharges to receiving waters are limited by outlet structures that function only during very large storm events.   Retention ponds are often landscaped with a variety of grasses, shrubs and/or wetland plants to provide bank stability and aesthetic benefits.  Vegetation also provides water quality benefits by removing soluble nutrients through uptake.  In some areas the ponds can attract nuisance types of wildlife like ducks or Canada geese, particularly where there is minimal landscaping and grasses are mowed.  This reduces the ability of foxes, coyotes and other predators to approach their prey unseen.  Such predators tend to hide in the cattails and other tall, thick grass surrounding natural water features.   Depth of retention ponds is of critical importance, for removal of pollutants and the volume of fish that could be inhabiting the pond. \n",

            "Text:  Retention basin  A retention basin, sometimes called a wet pond, wet detention basin or stormwater management pond, is an artificial lake with vegetation around the perimeter, and includes a permanent pool of water in its design.  It is used to manage stormwater runoff to prevent flooding and downstream erosion, and improve water quality in an adjacent river, stream, lake or bay.    It is distinguished from a detention basin, sometimes called a \"dry pond\", which temporarily stores water after a storm, but eventually empties out at a controlled rate to a downstream water body.  It also differs from an infiltration basin which is designed to direct stormwater to groundwater through permeable soils.   Wet ponds are frequently used for water quality improvement, groundwater recharge, flood protection, aesthetic improvement or any combination of these.  Sometimes they act as a replacement for the natural absorption of a forest or other natural process that was lost when an area is developed.  As such, these structures are designed to blend into neighborhoods and viewed as an amenity.   In urban areas, impervious surfaces (roofs, roads) reduce the time spent by rainfall before entering into the stormwater drainage system.  If left unchecked, this will cause widespread flooding downstream.  The function of a stormwater pond is to contain this surge and release it slowly. \n",

            "Text: If the pot sits in a tray, empty the tray after watering. Sogginess causes rot.  In their natural environments, orchids are air plants that never sit in water.  Germs and other microorganisms that grow in stagnant water can cause orchid roots to quickly die.  If you are not sure whether or not to water, stick your finger about 1 inch/2.5 cm in the potting media.  You may find that even though the top is dry, below the surface it is still damp.  Another way to determine whether or not to water is to feel the weight that water adds to the pot.  Lift the orchid pot after you have watered it to feel how heavy it is when wet.  Every few days lift it until it feels light.  The lighter weight indicates that it is dry and needs water.  Some orchids, such as Masdevallias , need to be watered every day.  Others, such as Cattleyas , only need to be watered once every two weeks.  Most kinds of orchids, including Phalaenopsis , Paphiopedilums , Oncidiums , and Dendrobiums , fall somewhere in between, requiring 2 or 3 waterings a week.  Use room temperature water.  If your local tap-water has lots of impurities or chemicals, use rainwater or filtered water.  When watering your orchid, the water will run right through the pot. \n",

A major issue with excluding rain while allowing air flow is that both tend to come from the same direction.  The angled slatted jalousie windows give the impression of solving this issue, however, the actual efficacy of the windows to let in air while keeping out water was deemed unsatisfactory by the study's authors.    Jalousie windows also have several other drawbacks.  Traditional style jalousie windows offer poor overall resistance to water penetration and drafts and are difficult to positively secure, as their slats are easily and silently removed.  In addition to the inability to keep out water, they do not provide a secure barrier to keep air conditioned air inside.  Also, the metal parts which make up the windows moving mechanism are prone to corrosion in humid environments, leading to damage such as broken or missing cranks.  Jalousie windows are objects of scorn for many Floridians, as the windows are unable to keep out human and insect home invaders.    Modern manufacturers have improved their designs of jalousie windows to address these problems.  Many market their products as having greater security and energy efficiency compared to earlier versions. \n",

            "Text:  Retention basin  A retention basin, sometimes called a wet pond, wet detention basin or stormwater management pond, is an artificial lake with vegetation around the perimeter, and includes a permanent pool of water in its design.  It is used to manage stormwater runoff to prevent flooding and downstream erosion, and improve water quality in an adjacent river, stream, lake or bay.    It is distinguished from a detention basin, sometimes called a \"dry pond\", which temporarily stores water after a storm, but eventually empties out at a controlled rate to a downstream water body.  It also differs from an infiltration basin which is designed to direct stormwater to groundwater through permeable soils.   Wet ponds are frequently used for water quality improvement, groundwater recharge, flood protection, aesthetic improvement or any combination of these.  Sometimes they act as a replacement for the natural absorption of a forest or other natural process that was lost when an area is developed.  As such, these structures are designed to blend into neighborhoods and viewed as an amenity.   In urban areas, impervious surfaces (roofs, roads) reduce the time spent by rainfall before entering into the stormwater drainage system.  If left unchecked, this will cause widespread flooding downstream.  The function of a stormwater pond is to contain this surge and release it slowly. \n",

Look in the: AboutOrchids Forum Understanding How Orchids Grow Rainforests are like crowded cities of plants and animals.  Trees grow like apartment buildings with many plant residents attached to their branches and trunks.  The trees crowd together as they reach for the sun.  Plants absorb light, water, and nutrients, and turn sunlight into energy.  Rain falls a lot, sometimes in massive downpours, other times in slow drips and drizzles.  High humidity, the amount of water vapor in the air, means it is always damp.  Breezes move the air, and temperatures fluctuate between daytime warmth and nighttime coolness.  Plants, animals, and insects leave debris.  These decompose quickly in the high humidity, leaving nutrients that are valuable assets and are consumed quickly.  Orchids are successful in this competitive environment because they grow as epiphytes, living on trees above the rain forest floor.  By growing as air plants, orchids are not shaded by dense plant growth on the ground. \n",

They recorded conversations early in each marriage and marked how many times they smiled, joked, raised their eyebrows or mocked each other.  Then, using a set of equations based on a branch of math related to chaos theory, Murray estimated how long each couple would remain married.  \"One equation incorporates how the wife will speak, depending on what the husband says, what her state of mind was before and so on. \n",

Comfort foods may be simple in themselves: mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, chocolate cake, ice cream.  In general, though, these foods taste good and immediately distract from a bad mood.  But most often, we crave carbohydrate-rich foods when our mood is low because they are easy to digest and quickly release serotonin for a calming effect.  \"They don't require much work for the body to break down,\" said the ADA's Taub-Dix.  \"Your body is saying, 'do me a favor, let's just take it easy, I don't want to work hard.'\" But this urge can backfire when unchecked.

It recognizes that it doesn’t know everything.  It has to know that it doesn’t know everything to see something new.”  And it is the “spiritual” hemisphere of the brain.  The right side of the brain is “very visionary, not very time-focussed, usually very good at relationships, and more imaginative.”  The drug associated with the right side of the brain is serotonin.  Serotonin produces the sensation: “I have, I’m good, I am a part of (fellowship).”  So, how do these two hemispheres work with each other?  Dr. Tarman argues that the right side of the brain should be the master but in today’s society, it’s not.  It’s the servant.  The master is our rational brain, the left brain. \n",

Prescription stimulants affect the brain through a slow and steady release of two neurotransmitters—dopamine and norepinephrine.  7 When prescribed and taken correctly, under medical supervision, these drugs can help treat a few health conditions, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), narcolepsy and, occasionally, depression.  In treating ADHD, prescription stimulants can help regulate and normalize the dopamine and norepinephrine function in the brain, so a patient with this condition can focus better and pay more attention.  Common brand-name prescription stimulants include Adderall, Ritalin, Dexedrine, and Benzedrine. 8  The Risk Abusing drugs that are prescribed to treat specific medical conditions is never a good idea.  And without a doctor’s supervision or monitoring, side effects can become harmful, or even dangerous.  Excessive vomiting, tremors, sweating and anxiety are just some of the risks of abusing stimulants.  When taken at high doses, with alcohol or with over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, stimulants can cause irregular heartbeat, dangerously high body temperatures and the potential for seizures or heart failure.  9 Long-Term Effects Stimulants can be addictive.  10 \n",

Your friend was probably prescribed Adderall to help him focus his thoughts and ignore distractions, so he can reach his full potential, but that is not happening when he gives his pills to someone else.

One of the most common causes of death from drinking alcohol is alcohol poisoning.  Binge drinking can be defined as drinking more than five standard drinks (four drinks for women) over two hours (A standard drink is usually thought as one beer, one shot of hard liquor, or one glass of wine).  Young adults who drink a lot a few times a year are just as likely to cause problems in their lives than those who drink every day.

All drugs of abuse affect the way your brain and body function.  Drugs have an immediate effect on your body, but they can also create long-lasting changes even when you have stopped taking the drug.  For instance, the effects of marijuana can “last” up to several hours from a single joint.  When people smoke pot, they may experience many things, such as feeling high, mellow, or relaxed.  But there are other feelings that you may have too.  Some people experience paranoia, high anxiety, irritability, mood swings, depression, and hallucinations while marijuana is in their bodies.  Drugs work by changing the way the brain normally works.  Drugs cause a release of a chemical called dopamine that the brain interprets as being pleasurable. \n",

Prolonged sitting on long flights can cause dangerous blood clots, which Archie says pregnant women are at a slightly higher risk of developing than the general public.  \"Flying is also very dehydrating,\" adds Archie.  \"And when you get dehydrated in pregnancy you tend to start having contractions.\"  But Archie points out that these contractions do not necessarily indicate labor.  To prevent these concerns from becoming serious problems, experts recommend expectant mothers stay well hydrated and get up and walk around the airplane when it is safe to do so.  And they say pregnant women should take into account that there are often longer waits at the airport due to heightened security in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks.  It's important to drink plenty of water before boarding the plane, they say.  As always, patients should discuss their travel plans and concerns with their obstetricians. \n",

Willis January 6, 2006, 6:03 AM • 4 min read Dec. 12, 2001 -- Most pregnant women who want to travel this holiday season should not fear that flying will cause complications or bring on motherhood a little sooner than expected.  According to new recommendations from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, healthy women with low-risk pregnancies can safely fly up until their 36th week, or one month prior to their due date.  Women who should not fly at any time during their pregnancy are those at risk for complications or pre-term delivery, including women with poorly controlled diabetes, pregnancy-induced high blood pressure, or sickle cell disease — which can be worsened by high altitude.  Can Flying Induce Early Labor?  Despite the experts' assurances, some women remain wary of flying during pregnancy.  Bonita Heilman went into labor in her 34th week, four hours after a flight from Minneapolis to Chicago to attend the wedding of a college roommate.  This was her first pregnancy, and according to Heilman, she had been considered low risk.  \"My doctor recommended that I not go,\" she says.  \"But she wrote me a note to tell the airline what week I was in.\" \n",

Sometimes, it is a desire to complete their education and become financially independent.  In many cases, couples with children wish to restrict their family size in order to provide them with adequate financial support.”  Almost all abortions performed in Canada are done because a pregnant woman chooses to end the pregnancy for personal reasons, not medical ones.  Medical necessity is rarely part of the decision.  What have the courts said?  Until 2005, no court in Canada had ever ruled that abortions must be publicly funded.  In 2005, Winnipeg judge Jeffrey Oliphant ruled that the failure to pay for private clinic abortions was a“gross violation” of women’s rights.  The decision was overturned in 2006 by the province’s Court of Appeal because the judge had not heard any evidence on the issues involved.  An appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was refused.  The provincial government had already begun paying for all abortions in 2005 but not as a result of the court case. \n",

In a first of its kind study published last week in the medical journal Lancet, researchers compared e-cigarettes to nicotine patches and other smoking cessation methods and found them statistically comparable in helping smokers quit over a six-month period.  For this reason, Glynn said he viewed the devices as promising though probably no magic bullet.  For now, FDA regulations forbid e-cigarette marketers from touting their devices as a way to kick the habit.

Furthermore, the two approaches need not necessarily be mutually exclusive.  Rehabilitation programs typically average about thirty days for primary care, but some may extend anywhere from ninety days to six months in an extended care unit.  It is considered essential by the programs that administer them that patients in abstinence-based treatment form networks with other addiction survivors and engage in mutual-help groups, aftercare and other related activities after treatment in order to improve their chances of achieving long-term abstinence from opioids.  Statistically, long-term abstinence is not widely prevalent.  Buprenorphine is sometimes used only during the detox protocol with the purpose of reducing the patient's use of mood-altering substances.  It considerably reduces acute opioid withdrawal symptoms that are normally experienced by opioid-dependent patients on cessation of those opioids, including diarrhea, vomiting, fever, chills, cold sweats, muscle and bone aches, muscle cramps and spasms, restless legs, agitation, gooseflesh, insomnia, nausea, watery eyes, runny nose and post-nasal drip, nightmares, etc. \n",

Dr. David Brendel answers the question: 'Depression And The Immune System?'  By David Brendel, M.D., Assistant Medical Director of The Pavilion, McLean Hospital April 29, 2008, 12:10 PM • 1 min read — -- Question: What is the relationship between depression and the immune system?  Answer: Depression really has profound effects on the immune system.  Depression can cause increases in a variety of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline and various other inflammatory substance such as interleukin-6.  Increases in all of these hormones and other substances can cause significant decrease in the body's ability to repair itself and for a variety of organ systems to function well.  This may lead to inflammatory conditions such as arthritis.  It can cause osteoporosis.  It may lead to various infections because of a breakdown in normal immune system functioning.  And it can also cause or worsen cancers.  So diagnosing and treating depression not only helps a person to feel and function better, but it may also preserve their long-term physical health.

( 1) Here, it is not necessary to mention that Salmon is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin B6.  It is an edible fish which is famous for its nutritional perspective.  If you are non-vegetarian, you can opt salmon as an anti depression food.  Six ounces of salmon contain more than half of your daily needs of omega-3 fatty acids.  Experts generally recommend it if you are are not vegetarian.  Salmon is also effective food for preventing depression; try eating fish twice per week for maximum benefit. \n",

            "Text: When food enters the stomach after a period of fasting, pepsinogen is converted to its active form—pepsin—in a series of steps initiated by the drop in pH. Pepsin catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide linkages within protein molecules. It has a fairly broad specificity but acts preferentially on linkages involving the aromatic amino acids tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine, as well as methionine and leucine.  Protein digestion is completed in the small intestine.  Pancreatic juice, carried from the pancreas via the pancreatic duct, contains inactive enzymes such as trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen.  They are activated in the small intestine as follows ( Figure 20.7 \"Activation of Some Pancreatic Enzymes in the Small Intestine\" ): The intestinal mucosal cells secrete the proteolytic enzyme enteropeptidase, which converts trypsinogen to trypsin; trypsin then activates chymotrypsinogen to chymotrypsin (and also completes the activation of trypsinogen).  Both of these active enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of peptide bonds in protein chains.  Chymotrypsin preferentially attacks peptide bonds involving the carboxyl groups of the aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine).  Trypsin attacks peptide bonds involving the carboxyl groups of the basic amino acids (lysine and arginine).  Pancreatic juice also contains procarboxypeptidase, which is cleaved by trypsin to carboxypeptidase. \n",

            "Text: Dimerization leads to a rapid activation of the protein's cytoplasmic kinase domains, the first substrate for these domains being the receptor itself. The activated receptor as a result then becomes autophosphorylated on multiple specific intracellular tyrosine residues.   Section::::Signal transduction.   Through diverse means, extracellular ligand binding will typically cause or stabilize receptor dimerization.  This allows a tyrosine in the cytoplasmic portion of each receptor monomer to be \"trans\"-phosphorylated by its partner receptor, propagating a signal through the plasma membrane.  The phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues within the activated receptor creates binding sites for Src homology 2 (SH2) domain- and phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain-containing proteins.   Specific proteins containing these domains include Src and phospholipase Cγ.  Phosphorylation and activation of these two proteins on receptor binding lead to the initiation of signal transduction pathways.  Other proteins that interact with the activated receptor act as adaptor proteins and have no intrinsic enzymatic activity of their own.  These adaptor proteins link RTK activation to downstream signal transduction pathways, such as the MAP kinase signalling cascade.  An example of a vital signal transduction pathway involves the tyrosine kinase receptor, c-met, which is required for the survival and proliferation of migrating myoblasts during myogenesis.  A lack of c-met disrupts secondary myogenesis and—as in LBX1—prevents the formation of limb musculature. \n",

            "Text: PTPs are capable of modifying the activity of receptor tyrosine kinases in both a positive and negative manner. PTPs can dephosphorylate the activated phosphorylated tyrosine residues on the RTKs which virtually leads to termination of the signal.  Studies involving PTP1B, a widely known PTP involved in the regulation of the cell cycle and cytokine receptor signaling, has shown to dephosphorylate the epidermal growth factor receptor and the insulin receptor.  Some PTPs, on the other hand, are cell surface receptors that play a positive role in cell signaling proliferation.  Cd45, a cell surface glycoprotein, plays a critical role in antigen-stimulated dephosphorylation of specific phosphotyrosines that inhibit the Src pathway.   Section::::Regulation.:Herstatin.   Herstatin is an autoinhibitor of the ErbB family, which binds to RTKs and blocks receptor dimerization and tyrosine phosphorylation.  CHO cells transfected with herstatin resulted in reduced receptor oligomerization, clonal growth and receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in response to EGF.   Section::::Regulation.:Receptor endocytosis.   Activated RTKs can undergo endocytosis resulting in down regulation of the receptor and eventually the signaling cascade.  The molecular mechanism involves the engulfing of the RTK by a clathrin-mediated endocytosis, leading to intracellular degradation.   Section::::Drug therapy.   RTKs have become an attractive target for drug therapy due to their implication in a variety of cellular abnormalities such as cancer, degenerative diseases and cardiovascular diseases. \n",

Prescription stimulants affect the brain through a slow and steady release of two neurotransmitters—dopamine and norepinephrine.  7 When prescribed and taken correctly, under medical supervision, these drugs can help treat a few health conditions, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), narcolepsy and, occasionally, depression.  In treating ADHD, prescription stimulants can help regulate and normalize the dopamine and norepinephrine function in the brain, so a patient with this condition can focus better and pay more attention.  Common brand-name prescription stimulants include Adderall, Ritalin, Dexedrine, and Benzedrine. 8  The Risk Abusing drugs that are prescribed to treat specific medical conditions is never a good idea.  And without a doctor’s supervision or monitoring, side effects can become harmful, or even dangerous.  Excessive vomiting, tremors, sweating and anxiety are just some of the risks of abusing stimulants.  When taken at high doses, with alcohol or with over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, stimulants can cause irregular heartbeat, dangerously high body temperatures and the potential for seizures or heart failure.  9 Long-Term Effects Stimulants can be addictive.  10 \n",

And because they work by slowing the brain’s activity, they can diminish heartbeat and respiration to dangerously low levels.  This is especially true when depressants are combined with alcohol or OTC medications.  It’s a combination that can even lead to death.  Long-Term Effects Depressants are highly addictive drugs, and when chronic users or abusers stop taking them, they can experience severe withdrawal symptoms, including anxiety, insomnia and muscle tremors.  In fact, going “cold turkey” off of some depressants can have life-threatening consequences, like seizures, convulsions and, in rare instances, death.  The Bottom Line Depressant drugs can make you depressed, confused and irritable.

Answer: There is a relationship between bipolar disorder and violence.  As there is a relationship between severe mental illness and violence in general.  The majority of people with bipolar disorder are not violent.  And those people who are, are typically in the midst of either a manic or depressive episode and drinking or using drugs.  In fact, the majority of violent acts are committed when people are acutely ill and when they are drinking in the context of substance abuse.  When people are manic, they can be irritable or aggressive.  And when people are depressed, they can become suicidal.  So when people are manic, they are more likely to become aggressive and violent with others, and when they're depressed, they're more likely to become violent towards themselves.  And the suicide rates in bipolar disorder are actually fairly high. \n",

Dr. Galynker answers the question: 'Is It A Mood Swing Or Bipolar Disorder?'  By Igor Galynker, M.D., Ph.D., Director, The Family Center for Bipolar Disorder, Beth Israel Medical Center April 29, 2008, 10:09 AM • 2 min read — -- Question: How can I tell the difference between \"mood swings\" and bipolar disorder?  Answer: Well, mood swings can be part of bipolar disorder.  Mood swings are changes in mood, the difference in mood swings in regular people and mood swings in bipolar disorder, is the severity and duration.  In regular people, the mood swings usually do not interfere with your life.  If you're a little bit down or a little bit up, you can still go to work.  You can still see your friends, you can still go to the movies, you can still make dinner, you can still take care of your children.  When a person has bipolar disorder, the mood swings are such that they disrupt your life, sometimes completely.  You can be so depressed that you cannot get out of bed. \n",

He was one of the 22 players interviewed by Lawrence Ritter and included in the original version of \"The Glory of Their Times\", a ground-breaking book that set a standard for oral histories of baseball.   Section::::Honors.   In addition to Roush's selection into the Baseball Hall of Fame, chosen with McKechnie, he is also a member of the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame, inducted in 1960.   Considered the greatest player in Reds' history at the time, Roush was invited to throw out the first ball at the last game at Crosley Field on June 24, 1970.

Murphy switched to the outfield in 1980, a move that would help initiate a decade of highly productive play in the National League.  Beginning in left field, he soon switched to center field, the position at which he would find his greatest success.  By 1982, the most decorated year of Murphy's career, the former catcher had transformed himself into an All-Star MVP outfielder who appeared in each of Atlanta's 162 games.  His turnaround as a fielder was equally stark.  In 1978, Murphy led all National League first basemen in errors.  In 1982, spending time at each of the three outfield positions, he won his first of five consecutive Gold Gloves, as well as the first MVP award by a Brave since Hank Aaron, in 1957 with what were then the Milwaukee Braves.   Playing in the decade before the Braves began their dominance of the National League East, Murphy also made his only postseason appearance in 1982.  Although he performed well, the eventual World Series-champion St. Louis Cardinals eliminated the Braves in the 1982 National League Championship Series. \n",

Sportswriter Bob Driscoll later attributed Wilhelm's difficulties in the mid-1950s to the decline in the career of Giants catcher Wes Westrum, writing that baseball was \"a game of inches, and for Hoyt, Wes had been that inch in the right direction.\"   Section::::Major league career.:Middle career.   On February 26, 1957, Wilhelm was traded by the Giants to the St. Louis Cardinals for Whitey Lockman.  At the time of the trade, St. Louis manager Fred Hutchinson described Wilhelm as the type of pitcher who \"makes us a definite pennant threat ...  He'll help us where we need help the most.\"  In 40 games with the Cardinals that season, he earned 11 saves but finished with a 1–4 record and his highest ERA to that point in his career (4.25).  The Cardinals placed him on waivers in September and he was claimed by the Cleveland Indians, who used him in two games that year.   In 1958, Cleveland manager Bobby Bragan used Wilhelm occasionally as a starter.  Although he had a 2.49 ERA, none of the Indians' catchers could handle Wilhelm's knuckleball. \n",

Through his 16 years in professional baseball, Bonilla accumulated a .279 batting average, with a .358 on-base percentage and a .472 slugging.  He was on the Florida Marlins team that won the 1997 World Series.  Bonilla led the league in extra base hits (78) during the 1990 MLB season and doubles (44) during the 1991 MLB season.  He also participated in six MLB All-Star Games and won three Silver Slugger Awards.   From 1992 to 1994, Bonilla was the highest-paid player in the major leagues, earning more than $6 million per year.  Since 2011, he has been paid approximately $1.19 million by the New York Mets each year and is the poster boy for the mutually beneficial practice among major league teams for deferring contractual payments until well after the player has retired.  The payments come every July 1, which some media members refer to as \"Bobby Bonilla Day\".  This was part of a deal made when the Mets released Bonilla before the 2000 season while still owing him $5.9 million for the final year of his contract. \n",

The estate of Hopper, who had been married five times, has been in dispute since his death in 2010 at the age of 74.  Hopper had been in a dispute over a divorce settlement with his most recent wife, Victoria Duffy-Hopper, which failed to resolve before his death from advanced prostate cancer.  Joseph Mannis, Hopper's former divorce attorney and one of the lawyers representing his estate, told ABC News that a settlement is expected to be reached in a week then brought before a probate judge for approval.  Everyone, including Galen Hopper's attorney, has signed off on the settlement except for one party, whom Mannis declined to reveal. \n",

Depending on what you're doing, your heart will pump one to seven gallons of blood a minute, and as much as 2000 gallons a day.

Also, closing your blinds in the evening may give you some added insulation.  Using your fan in the winter actually can help you retain heat in your house.  Adjust your fan so it turns clockwise.  This way, warm air will be pushed down from your ceiling.  If you would like to weatherize your home but can't afford it, the government may be able to help.

This is the reverse arrangement to that usually but not always seen in the fire tubes of a boiler; there the hot gases usually pass through tubes immersed in water, whereas in an economizer the water passes through tubes surrounded by hot gases.  While both are heat exchange devices, in a \"boiler\" the burning gases heat the water to produce steam to drive an engine, whether piston or turbine, whereas in an \"economizer\", some of the heat energy that would otherwise all be lost to the atmosphere is instead used to heat the water and/or air that will go into the boiler, thus saving fuel.  The most successful feature of Green's design of economizer was its mechanical scraping apparatus, which was needed to keep the tubes free of deposits of soot.   Economizers were eventually fitted to virtually all stationary steam engines in the decades following Green's invention.  Some preserved stationary steam engine sites still have their Green's economisers although usually they are not used.  One such preserved site is the Claymills Pumping Engines Trust in Staffordshire, England, which is in the process of restoring one set of economisers and the associated steam engine which drove them. \n",

Section::::Refrigeration.:Economizer setups in refrigeration.:Internal heat exchangers.   Subcooling may also be produced by superheating the gas leaving the evaporator and heading to the gas compressor.  These systems withdraw heat from the liquid line but heat up the gas compressors suction.  This is a very common solution to insure that gas reaches the compressor and liquid reaches the valve.  It also allows maximum heat exchanger use as minimizes the portion of the heat exchangers used to change the temperature of the fluid, and maximizes the volume in which the refrigerant changes its phase (phenomena involving much more heat flow, the base principle of vapor-compression refrigeration).   An internal heat exchanger is simply a type of heat exchanger that uses the cold gas leaving the evaporator coil to cool the high-pressure liquid that is headed into the beginning of the evaporator coil via an expansion device.  The gas is used to chill a chamber that normally has a series of pipes for the liquid running through it.  The superheated gas then proceeds on to the compressor.  The subcooling term refers to cooling the liquid below its boiling point. \n",

            "Text:  For example, for a walk-in freezer that is kept at , the main refrigeration components would include: an evaporator coil (a dense arrangement of pipes containing refrigerant and thin metal fins used to remove heat from inside the freezer), fans to blow air over the coil and around the box, an air-cooled condensing unit sited outdoors, and valves and piping. The condensing unit would include a compressor and a coil and fans to exchange heat with the ambient air.   An economizer display takes advantage of the fact that refrigeration systems have increasing efficiencies at increasing pressures and temperatures.  The power the gas compressor needs is strongly correlated to both the ratio and the difference, between the discharge and the suction pressures (as well as to other features like the refrigerant's heat capacity and the type of compressor).  Low temperature systems such as freezers move less fluid in same volumes.  That means the compressor's pumping is less efficient on low temperature systems.  This phenomenon is notorious when taking in account that the evaporation temperature for a walk-in freezer at may be around .   Systems with economizers aim to produce part of the refrigeration work on high pressures, condition in which gas compressors are normally more efficient. \n",

Such jackets cost between $10 and $20, but they could save you an added 4 to 9 percent on water heating costs, Hobson said, adding that the cover would pay for itself in about a year.  You can get a jacket or blanket at any hardware store, she noted.  Insulation Is Key Proper insulation is vital to keeping your heating costs down in the winter and your cooling costs down in the summer, but your current home may not have the most efficient level of insulation.  To determine the most economic insulation level for your house, go to the U.S. Department of Energy's zip code insulation calculator.  The cost of updating insulation on the typical attic generally starts around $500, but you could save at least 20 percent on your monthly heating bill, so the installment could pay for itself in a year, Hobson said.

As of 2010, geothermal electricity generation is used in 24 countries, while geothermal heating is in use in 70 countries.   International markets grew at an average annual rate of 5 percent over the three years to 2015, and global geothermal power capacity is expected to reach 14.5–17.6 GW by 2020.    Geothermal power is considered to be a sustainable, renewable source of energy because the heat extraction is small compared with the Earth's heat content.  The greenhouse gas emissions of geothermal electric stations are on average 45 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour of electricity, or less than 5 percent of that of conventional coal-fired plants.  As a source of renewable energy for both power and heating, geothermal has the potential to meet 3-5% of global demand by 2050.

            "Text: Such systems have the advantage of not interfering with the original design of the refrigeration system being an interesting alternative for expanding single staged systems that do not possess an economizer compressor.  Section::::Refrigeration.:Economizer setups in refrigeration.:Internal heat exchangers.   Subcooling may also be produced by superheating the gas leaving the evaporator and heading to the gas compressor.  These systems withdraw heat from the liquid line but heat up the gas compressors suction.  This is a very common solution to insure that gas reaches the compressor and liquid reaches the valve.  It also allows maximum heat exchanger use as minimizes the portion of the heat exchangers used to change the temperature of the fluid, and maximizes the volume in which the refrigerant changes its phase (phenomena involving much more heat flow, the base principle of vapor-compression refrigeration).   An internal heat exchanger is simply a type of heat exchanger that uses the cold gas leaving the evaporator coil to cool the high-pressure liquid that is headed into the beginning of the evaporator coil via an expansion device.  The gas is used to chill a chamber that normally has a series of pipes for the liquid running through it.  The superheated gas then proceeds on to the compressor.  The subcooling term refers to cooling the liquid below its boiling point. \n",

            "Text: The flash economizer is different because it doesn't use a heat exchanger to produce the subcooling. Instead, it has a flash chamber or tank, in which flash gas is produced to lower the temperature of the liquid before the expansion.  The flash gas that is produced in this tank leaves the liquid line and goes to the economizer entrance of the screw compressor.   Section::::Refrigeration.:Economizer setups in refrigeration.:Subcooling and refrigeration cycle optimizers.   All previous systems produce an economizer effect by using compressors, meters, valves and heat exchangers within the refrigeration cycle.  Depending on the system, in some refrigeration cycles it may be convenient to produce the economizer using an independent refrigeration mechanism.  Such is the case of subcooling the liquid line by any other means that draw the heat out of the main system.  For example, a heat exchanger that preheats cold water needed for another process or human use, may withdraw the heat from the liquid line, effectively subcooling the line and increasing the system's capacity.   Recently, machines exclusively designated for this purpose have been developed.  In Chile, the manufacturer EcoPac Systems developed a cycle optimizer able to stabilize the temperature of the liquid line and allowing either an increase in the refrigeration capacity of the system, or a reduction of the power consumption. \n",

            "Text:  For example, for a walk-in freezer that is kept at , the main refrigeration components would include: an evaporator coil (a dense arrangement of pipes containing refrigerant and thin metal fins used to remove heat from inside the freezer), fans to blow air over the coil and around the box, an air-cooled condensing unit sited outdoors, and valves and piping. The condensing unit would include a compressor and a coil and fans to exchange heat with the ambient air.   An economizer display takes advantage of the fact that refrigeration systems have increasing efficiencies at increasing pressures and temperatures.  The power the gas compressor needs is strongly correlated to both the ratio and the difference, between the discharge and the suction pressures (as well as to other features like the refrigerant's heat capacity and the type of compressor).  Low temperature systems such as freezers move less fluid in same volumes.  That means the compressor's pumping is less efficient on low temperature systems.  This phenomenon is notorious when taking in account that the evaporation temperature for a walk-in freezer at may be around .   Systems with economizers aim to produce part of the refrigeration work on high pressures, condition in which gas compressors are normally more efficient. \n",
